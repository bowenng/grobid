	<div type="abstract">We present the Webis-STEREO-21 dataset, a massive collection of Scientific Text Reuse in Open-access<lb/> publications. It contains 91 million cases of reused text passages found in 4.2 million unique open-<lb/>access publications. Cases range from overlap of as few as eight words to near-duplicate publications<lb/> and include a variety of reuse types, ranging from boilerplate text to verbatim copying to quotations<lb/> and paraphrases. Featuring a high coverage of scientific disciplines and varieties of reuse, as well<lb/> as comprehensive metadata to contextualize each case, our dataset addresses the most salient<lb/> shortcomings of previous ones on scientific writing. The Webis-STEREO-21 does not indicate if a reuse<lb/> case is legitimate or not, as its focus is on the general study of text reuse in science, which is legitimate<lb/> in the vast majority of cases. It allows for tackling a wide range of research questions from different<lb/> scientific backgrounds, facilitating both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the phenomenon as<lb/> well as a first-time grounding on the base rate of text reuse in scientific publications.<lb/></div>
