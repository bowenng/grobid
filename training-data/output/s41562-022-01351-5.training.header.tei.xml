	<div type="abstract">Citations and text analysis are both used to study the distribution and flow of ideas between researchers, fields and countries,<lb/> but the resulting flows are rarely equal. We argue that the differences in these two flows capture a growing global inequality<lb/> in the production of scientific knowledge. We offer a framework called &apos;citational lensing&apos; to identify where citations should<lb/> appear between countries but are absent given that what is embedded in their published abstract texts is highly similar. This<lb/> framework also identifies where citations are overabundant given lower similarity. Our data come from nearly 20 million papers<lb/> across nearly 35 years and 150 fields from the Microsoft Academic Graph. We find that scientific communities increasingly<lb/> centre research from highly active countries while overlooking work from peripheral countries. This inequality is likely to pose<lb/> substantial challenges to the growth of novel ideas.<lb/></div>
