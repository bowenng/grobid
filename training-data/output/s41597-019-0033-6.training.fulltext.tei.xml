			<p>dataset capturing careers of individual Nobel laureates over the past century, which could then serve as an empir-<lb/>ical starting point for future quantitative studies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here we build an open-access dataset on the scientific careers of Nobel laureates <ref type="biblio">43</ref> . Despite a plethora of data<lb/> capturing the various contributions of scientific elites, such information is often located in unstructured, isolated<lb/> sources. Here, by combining unstructured information collected from Nobel Prize official websites, laureates&apos;<lb/> personal and university websites, Wikipedia entries, and publication and citation records from the MAG, we con-<lb/>structed a unique dataset of career histories for nearly all Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or<lb/> Medicine from 1900 to 2016 (545 out of 590, 92.4%). We validated this dataset using four different approaches to<lb/> ensure the reliability of our results, including comparison with manually collected CVs, selected Google Scholar<lb/> (GS) profiles, additional affiliation information, and random selection of 60 Nobel laureates (20 for each field) for<lb/> manual verification. The total data collection and validation procedure took more than 1000 hours.<lb/></p>

			<p>The curated data could serve as critical input that feeds into several promising research directions. <ref type="biblio">(1)</ref> The data<lb/> make available quantitative patterns of productivity, collaboration, and impact governing the careers of scientific<lb/> elites, offering a unique opportunity to systematically identify quantitative signals tracing the careers of elite sci-<lb/>entists. (2) Combining our datasets with publication records that capture the careers of ordinary scientists offers<lb/> opportunities for an array of fascinating comparative studies. Such studies would deepen our understanding<lb/> of the factors driving exceptional scientific careers, helping us answer the broad question of what makes great<lb/> scientists great.<lb/> As a more concrete example, we present two new findings using the curated dataset in the associated commen-<lb/>tary <ref type="biblio">44</ref> . Briefly, we find that careers of Nobel laureates are characterized by remarkably similar patterns as those of<lb/> ordinary scientists. For example, apart from the prize-winning paper, all other important works in Nobel careers<lb/> closely follow the random impact rule <ref type="biblio">10,11</ref> , a finding that is contrary to the common belief that Nobel laureates<lb/> tend to do critical work early in their careers. Further, the laureates also show a tendency toward collaborative<lb/> research in larger teams, which runs counter to the iconic image of lone geniuses making solo contributions.<lb/></p>

			<p>These results only represent some initial examples of how such datasets can help advance our quantitative<lb/> understanding of career dynamics. Indeed, our dataset may help uncover a set of reproducible principles under-<lb/>lying individual creativity, offering insights into the conditions and environments that best facilitate scientific<lb/> creativity and the genesis of scientific breakthroughs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>We constructed the publication records for almost all Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or<lb/> medicine from 1900 to 2016 (545 out of 590, 92.4%). We first collected information manually from Nobel Prize<lb/> official websites, their university websites, and Wikipedia. We then matched it algorithmically with big data, trac-<lb/>ing publication records from the MAG database. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the data collection framework. Next, we describe<lb/> how we collected and reconstructed the data we used in the project.<lb/></p>

			<head>MAG dataset.</head>

			<p>The MAG data contains scientific publication records, interlinked through the citation rela-<lb/>tionships between them, together with information about authors, institutions, publication venues (e.g. journals<lb/> or conferences), and fields of study <ref type="biblio">45</ref></p>

 . The dataset is updated on a weekly basis and contains 174,910,379 papers,<lb/> 210,983,748 authors, 228,843 fields of study, 4,028 conferences, 47,963 journals, and 25,558 institutions as of June<lb/> 2018.<lb/></figure>

			<p>the biographical website for Nobel laureates. One advantage of studying Nobel laureates is that there<lb/> is a large amount of information available and it is well-maintained by different organizations. Here we make use<lb/> of three important sources: the Nobel Foundation&apos;s website, Wikipedia webpages for the laureates, and university<lb/> websites for the laureates.<lb/></p>

We first manually collected each laureate&apos;s prize-winning<lb/> paper and other &quot;ground-truth&quot; papers from multiple sources such as Nobel Prize official websites, Wikipedia,<lb/> and their home pages, and matched these papers in MAG database as seeds. The entire publication record for<lb/> each laureate is then collected through a &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; process. The red plus symbols indicate the laureate&apos;s<lb/> papers while the red minus symbols represent noise papers. The obtained dataset is validated with external<lb/> sources, including CVs, GS profiles, affiliation information, and manual verifications.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(1) The Nobel Foundation&apos;s website. The Nobel Foundation&apos;s website (nobelprize.org) offers a rich source of<lb/> information about Nobel laureates. It contains numerous site-accessible documents, photos, audiotapes,<lb/> videotapes, films, and articles for each laureate.<lb/> (2) Wikipedia pages. Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free encyclopedia based on a model of openly<lb/> editable and viewable content (https://www.wikipedia.org/). All Nobel laureates have dedicated pages<lb/> which offer detailed biographical information including biographies, scientific activities, selected publica-<lb/>tion records, awards, and honors, etc.<lb/> (3) University websites for Nobel laureates. Nobel laureates&apos; personal homepages or lab websites offer an<lb/> official account of their career records. These websites usually highlight several selected publications by<lb/> the Nobel laureates, and sometimes even include an expanded list of all publications and official CVs.<lb/> Although university websites are not guaranteed to be up-to-date, the information listed on these websites<lb/> is, in general, highly accurate.<lb/></p>

			<p>identifying prize-winning papers. The availability of information about Nobel laureates creates an<lb/> unprecedented opportunity to identify laureates&apos; prize-winning work and to systematically collect their publica-<lb/>tion records throughout their careers. For each Nobel laureate, we collected data on the timing of prize-winning<lb/> work, prize motivation, the title and year of the Nobel lecture, and the author and institution information on<lb/> prize-winning work if it was available.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Nobel lecture provides detailed information about the prize-winning work. As such, the prize-winning<lb/> papers are usually cited as references to the Nobel lecture. We collected all the references of Nobel lectures and<lb/> manually collected the prize-winning papers identified in each Nobel lecture. For those that were not mentioned<lb/> specifically in these lectures, we classify the reference of the Nobel lecture as a prize-winning paper if it satisfies all<lb/> of the following criteria: (1) The Nobel laureate is in the author list of the reference paper, i.e., the paper has at least<lb/> one author with the same last name and first name (or first initial if the full first name is missing) with the Nobel<lb/> winner. For an author with a middle name or middle initial, such information must be consistent as well; (2) The<lb/> paper was published within the same period of prize-winning papers; (3) Institution and co-author information<lb/> of the reference is consistent with other auxiliary information about the prize-winning work; (4) The topic of the<lb/> reference paper is consistent with the Nobel Prize motivation. If there are multiple papers that satisfy the criteria<lb/> (1-4), we assume that prize-winning papers garner higher impact (measured by total citation). Following these<lb/> procedures, we manually identified and collected the prize-winning papers for all laureates in our sample (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In rare cases where prize-winning papers cannot be reliably identified from the references of the Nobel lec-<lb/>tures, we consulted other sources: (1) Nobel laureates&apos; Wikipedia page usually offers a detailed personal biog-<lb/>raphy, which contains their prize-winning contributions and mentions of prize-winning papers. (2) Important<lb/> works are usually selected by the Nobel laureates and displayed on their personal homepage or lab website, which<lb/> can help us to identify the prize-winning papers. (3) Existing studies have collected some of the prize-winning<lb/> papers. For example, Shen and Barabasi 27 collected the prize-winning papers for Nobel laureates in Physics<lb/> (1995-2013), Chemistry (1998-2013), <ref type="biblio">Medicine (2006-2013)</ref>, and Economics <ref type="biblio">(1995-2013)</ref>. Our data collection<lb/> also takes into account these existing efforts.<lb/></p>

			<p>We matched all prize-winning papers with the MAG database. Together, we gathered 874 prize-winning<lb/> papers for 545 Nobel laureates, including 283 prize-winning papers for 193 laureates in Physics, 259 prize-winning<lb/> papers for 163 laureates in Chemistry, and 332 prize-winning papers for 189 laureates in Medicine.<lb/></p>

			<head>Name disambiguation procedure.</head>

			<p>A key challenge in analyzing scholarly databases is to identify the<lb/> individual(s) who wrote a paper and, conversely, to identify all of the works that belong to a given individual <ref type="biblio">46-48</ref> .<lb/> This seemingly simple task represents a major unsolved problem for information and computer sciences, and a<lb/> major roadblock to studies of individual careers. Here we exploit one important feature of the MAG data. Indeed,<lb/> one major advantage of the MAG dataset is that author profiles have been processed through a well-designed dis-<lb/>ambiguation algorithm that optimizes the accuracy of a profile <ref type="biblio">45,48,49</ref> . That is, each disambiguated profile in MAG<lb/> may not contain all the papers published by an individual, but papers that are included in the profile do belong to<lb/> the same person with high accuracy. In other words, MAG may split one scientist&apos;s publication record into sev-<lb/>eral different profiles, optimizing accuracy at the expense of recall. Note that authors themselves can also claim<lb/> and assemble different profiles into one (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/articles/<lb/> microsoft-academic-uses-knowledge-address-problem-conflation-disambiguation/), offering additional crowd<lb/> intelligence to assist in the disambiguation procedure. This also suggests that if we could intelligently combine<lb/> these profiles, we may be able to curate individual profiles with both high precision and recall.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper, we adopt a &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; procedure <ref type="biblio">50</ref> , a method similar to label propagation in machine<lb/> learning <ref type="biblio">51</ref> to merge various MAG author profiles into one. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the detailed steps of the name disam-<lb/>biguation procedure, introduced as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) Manually collecting laureates&apos; papers. As part of identifying prize-winning papers, we have collected and<lb/> identified several of the laureates&apos; papers, including the prize-winning papers, Nobel lecture papers, and<lb/> other papers collected from their Wikipedia page, the Nobel official website, and their own homepage.<lb/> These manually collected laureates&apos; papers are referred to as ground-truth papers.<lb/> (2) Matching laureates&apos; papers into the MAG dataset as seeds. We then match these collected laureates&apos; papers<lb/> into the MAG dataset using the following rules: Two papers are identical if they share the same Digital<lb/> Object Identifier (DOI). In cases where the DOI is missing, they are considered to be the same paper if<lb/> the following matching rules are satisfied: (1) the two papers were published within ±1 years; (2) the two<lb/> papers have the same number of authors; (3) author sequence of the two papers is the same; (4) the text<lb/> similarity, defined as the cosine similarity between the titles of the paper after removing stop words and<lb/> punctuation, is higher than 0.75.<lb/> (3) Creating a pool of all candidate MAG profiles for each laureate. We then created a pool of all candidate MAG<lb/> profiles for each laureate according to the same rules followed by the literature 11 : (1) the author&apos;s last name<lb/> is identical to the laureate&apos;s last name; (2) initial of the first name is identical to the laureate&apos;s first initial. If an<lb/> author&apos;s full first name is available, it must be the same as the laureate&apos;s; (3) for those authors who have middle<lb/> names, the middle initial must be the same as the laureate&apos;s. If the author&apos;s full middle name is available, it also<lb/> must be consistent with the laureate&apos;s middle name. (4) For each laureate, all the publication records under the<lb/> potential MAG author&apos;s profiles constitute the candidate pool of papers for the laureate.<lb/> (4) Building a citation network within the candidate paper pool through the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; process. One as-<lb/>sumption for the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; process is that scientists are more likely to cite their own published work<lb/> due to topical relevance or intellectual similarity between the papers. Thus, their own papers are usually<lb/> connected through a citation network. Starting with the seed papers, we take candidate papers that have<lb/> cited at least one of the seed papers and expand the pool of seeds iteratively. The process stops when there<lb/> are no papers left in the candidate paper pool to be added to the network (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

Step 1:<lb/> The official website of the Nobel Prize, nobelprize.org, offers rich information for identifying the prize-winning<lb/> works of Nobel laureates, including the year or period of the prize-winning achievement, the prize motivation,<lb/> the title of the Nobel Lecture, etc. Step 2: We can obtain detailed information on the Nobel Lecture in the<lb/> MAG dataset. Step 3: We can identify the prize-winning paper from the reference of the Nobel Lecture using<lb/> information derived in Step 1.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(5) Merging candidate MAG author profiles. For each Nobel laureate, we have a pool of candidate MAG au-<lb/>thors. We then merge all the candidate MAG author profiles that have at least one paper in the citation net-<lb/>work. Combining the merged MAG author&apos;s profiles yields the entire publication history for each laureate.<lb/></p>

			<p>Together, we curated publication records for each Nobel laureate, totaling 93,394 journal papers for 545 Nobel<lb/> laureates.<lb/></p>

			<p>reliability validation of the manually collected ground-truth papers. The manually collected<lb/> ground-truth papers play an important role in the name disambiguation procedure. These ground-truth papers<lb/> are matched into the MAG dataset as seeds, which are the starting point of the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; process. Here<lb/> we conducted cross-validation with additional information such as co-authors, affiliations, timing, a paper&apos;s key-<lb/>words, and even e-mail information, if available, to double check each manually collected laureates&apos; paper. We did<lb/> a lot of tinkering to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the collected papers, trying to minimize the human<lb/> errors accounted for in the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; procedure. Nevertheless, although all these steps help reduce any<lb/> potential human errors in the data curation process, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the collected data, readers<lb/> should take note of the possibility that there may still be errors that remain unaccounted for given the manual<lb/> processes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data records<lb/> Data structure.</head>

			<p>We built an open-access dataset on publication records for Nobel laureates in Physics,<lb/> Chemistry, and Medicine, which is available at Harvard Dataverse <ref type="biblio">43</ref> . It contains four comma-separated values<lb/> (CSV) files named &quot;Prize-winning paper record, &quot; &quot;Physics publication record, &quot;<lb/> &quot;Chemistry publication record,&quot; and &quot;Medicine publication record.&quot; The details are further described in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;Prize-winning paper record&quot; contains information about prize-winning papers, including &quot;Field, &quot; &quot;Laureate<lb/> ID, &quot; &quot;Laureate name, &quot; &quot;Prize year, &quot; &quot;Title, &quot; &quot;Pub year, &quot; &quot;Paper ID, &quot; and &quot;Additional information&quot; (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). &quot;Field&quot;<lb/> refers to the Nobel laureate&apos;s field, i.e., Physics, Chemistry, or Medicine. We assign a unique &quot;Laureate ID&quot; for each<lb/> laureate, and his/her name and prize-winning year are referred to as &quot;Laureate name&quot; and &quot;Prize year. &quot; &quot;Title&quot;<lb/> and &quot;Pub year&quot; refers to the paper title and publication year of the prize-winning paper. &quot;Paper ID&quot; refers to<lb/></p>

			<p>Step 3: Creating a pool of all candidate MAG profiles for each laureate (automatic algorithm)<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Name disambiguation procedure and reliability validation. We curated the Nobel laureates&apos; publication<lb/> records through a name disambiguation procedure. The procedure consists of five steps: first, we manually<lb/> collect laureates&apos; papers; next, the collected laureates&apos; papers are matched into the MAG dataset as seeds; we<lb/> then create a pool of all candidate MAG profiles for each laureate through certain name matching rules; we<lb/> build a citation network within the candidate paper pool through the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; process; finally, all<lb/> the candidate MAG author profiles are merged to obtain the curated publication record for each laureate.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reliability of the curated dataset is verified through four different approaches, including comparison with<lb/> manually collected CVs, selected Google Scholar (GS) profiles, additional affiliation information, and random<lb/> selection of 60 Nobel laureates (20 for each field) for manual verification.<lb/></p>

Banting for the discov-<lb/>ery of insulin (https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/macleod/facts/); the experiment that resulted in<lb/> the discovery was mainly conducted by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in John MacLeod&apos;s laboratory in 1921<lb/> and was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine under the<lb/> names Frederick Banting and Charles Best; Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting&apos;s<lb/> and Best&apos;s work (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Macleod_(physiologist)).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The three files named &quot;Physics publication record, &quot; &quot;Chemistry publication record, &quot; and &quot;Medicine publication<lb/> record&quot; contain the publication records of Nobel laureates for Physics, Chemistry, and Medicine, respectively.<lb/> Each file includes the following data fields (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>): &quot;Laureate ID, &quot; &quot;Laureate name, &quot; &quot;Prize year, &quot; &quot;Title, &quot; &quot;Pub<lb/> year, &quot; &quot;Paper ID, &quot; &quot;DOI, &quot; &quot;Journal, &quot; &quot;Affiliation, &quot; and &quot;Is prize-winning paper. &quot; Each data field is self-explanatory<lb/> by its name, and fields with the same name as other tables follow the same data format and can be linked across<lb/> tables. &quot;DOI&quot; and &quot;Journal&quot; refer to the DOI and the published journal for each collected paper. &quot;Affiliation&quot; refers<lb/> to the Nobel laureate&apos;s affiliation while publishing the paper. &quot;Is prize-winning paper&quot; shows whether the paper is<lb/> prize-winning or not. If the paper is a prize-winning paper, the value of the item &quot;Is prize-winning paper&quot; is set<lb/> as &quot;YES, &quot; otherwise it is set as &quot;NO. &quot;<lb/> Descriptive statistics.

Then the ground-truth papers are matched into the MAG dataset<lb/> as seed papers (red plus symbols). (b) A pool of all candidate MAG author&apos;s profiles for each laureate are<lb/> collected via name matching.

The yellow minus symbol<lb/> represents noise papers. (c) Name disambiguation process of the &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; algorithm. Starting with<lb/> the original seed papers, we take candidate papers that have cited at least one of the seed papers as new seeds<lb/> iteratively.

			<p>the most productive, with each person publishing an average of 262 papers over their entire career, which is more<lb/> than twice that of the Physics laureates&apos; average. We also find the mean age at which Nobel laureates did their<lb/> prize-winning work is around 40, with no major age differences across disciplines. However, recognition for the<lb/> prize-winning work always takes a long time, with Nobel laureates waiting an average of 17 years to win the Prize<lb/> after making their prize-winning work.<lb/></p>

			<p>technical Validation<lb/> reliability validation. To understand the reliability of the curated dataset, we take the following four differ-<lb/>ent approaches to validate the data.<lb/></p>

			<p>Validation with CVs of the laureates. We manually collected 30 laureates&apos; CVs from their personal websites, lab<lb/> homepages, or university homepages which contain their full list of publications. Compared against these publi-<lb/>cation histories as the gold standard, our data shows a high precision and recall at 82.3% and 92.2% respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>Validation with GS profiles. Google provides scholar profiles for scientists to create, maintain and update their own<lb/> publication records. Armed with Google&apos;s proprietary name disambiguation algorithms, Google Scholar profiles may<lb/> represent a comprehensive collection of individual publication histories. Keep in mind, however, that GS profiles tend<lb/> to cover currently active scientists, and only a modest fraction of Nobel laureates have their own GS profiles. We col-<lb/>lected GS publication records for 29 Nobel laureates. Since GS indexes not only journal publications but also confer-<lb/>ences, patents, reports, meeting abstracts, talks, reviews, and even slides, here we consider only journal publications.<lb/></p>

			<p>Compared against the 29 GS profiles, our data shows precision and recall of 87.2% and 84.2% respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>Validation with additional affiliation information. More than 80% of publications we collected contain author<lb/> affiliations, allowing us to use additional affiliation information to verify the reliability of our data. For each Nobel<lb/> laureate, we first collected his/her affiliations from his/her Wikipedia and University homepage. Then we went<lb/> through the curated publication list to check if the affiliation information recorded in the paper was consistent<lb/> with the laureate&apos;s career history. We find our data has high accuracy (97.6%).<lb/></p>

			<head>Manual checkup.</head>

			<p>The MAG matched the biography information for a selected fraction of Nobel laureates from the<lb/> Wikipedia to the author profiles. We can access this information from the MAG API (https://academic.microsoft.com/).<lb/> We randomly selected 60 Nobel laureates (20 for each field) to manually check the reliability of our data.<lb/> In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we illustrate this process through the example of David Baltimore, an American biologist who won<lb/> the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975. We identified and merged 24 MAG author profiles with<lb/> the same name (David Baltimore), in which only three MAG author profiles contain more than five papers,<lb/> and the rest contain only one or two papers each. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the three main author profile pages of David<lb/> Baltimore in the MAG API, suggesting that the three author profiles were considered different partly due to<lb/> a<lb/> b<lb/> c<lb/> different affiliations: California Institute of Technology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Salk Institute<lb/> for Biological Studies. We further checked his affiliations, finding that David Baltimore worked at Albert Einstein<lb/> College of Medicine, then moved to Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla as an independent research<lb/> associate, and he also served as the president of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). We manually<lb/> checked all the papers under the 21 different MAG author profiles and calculate the accuracy. Manually counting<lb/> through the papers, we find the accuracy of our data is 97.3% within the 60 careers we selected.<lb/></p>

			<p>Validation of the reproducibility of the dataset and method. In this paper, we adopt a<lb/> &quot;Seed + Expand&quot; procedure to solve the name disambiguation problems of Nobel laureates. The proposed method<lb/> is a hybrid procedure consisting of five steps, combining manual process and automatic algorithm. It is worth<lb/> noting that only step one needs a manual collection of laureates&apos; papers, and the other four steps (from step two<lb/> to step five) can be fulfilled automatically with established procedures and rules. The highly automated process of<lb/> our method guarantees the reproducibility of the dataset and method.<lb/></p>

			<p>Together, we present a novel systematic dataset recording career information of Nobel laureates in science.<lb/> Although the curated data offers, to our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive publication records of Nobel<lb/> laureates so far, the goal of publishing this dataset is to allow all interested readers to help further refine and<lb/> improve the quality of the data.<lb/> references</p>
