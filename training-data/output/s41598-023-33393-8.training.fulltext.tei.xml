			<p>MPs pose significant environmental and health concerns because of their persistence in the environment,<lb/> potential toxicity, and ability to absorb contaminants and pathogens from the environment. However, the long-<lb/>term effects of MPs on human health are currently unknown <ref type="biblio">9</ref> . Most studies that examined the health effects of<lb/> MPs have used animal subjects. The ingestion of MPs has been shown to cause an inflammatory response and<lb/> can damage the gut, disrupt gut microorganisms, cause organ damage, and affect reproduction and metabolism.<lb/> Breathing in MPs can cause inflammation and chemical toxicity and introduce pathogenic microorganisms into<lb/> the body. MPs introduced through skin contact can cause skin damage due to local inflammation and cellular<lb/> toxicity <ref type="biblio">10</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Notably, the use of face masks made of synthetic fibers and disposable food containers during the corona-<lb/>virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have contributed to the exposure of MPs <ref type="biblio">11,12</ref> . Further, most<lb/> plastic products have been known to release estrogenic chemicals or endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) <ref type="biblio">13</ref> .<lb/> Exposure to EDCs and estrogenic chemicals may increase the risk of cancer or metabolic syndromes, including<lb/> obesity <ref type="biblio">11,14</ref> . Currently, there is a lack of evidence on the actual risks of MPs relating to cancer development or<lb/> metabolic diseases, despite claims in scientific articles. This study evaluated the effect of polypropylene MPS<lb/> (PPMPs) on human breast cancer cells. We found that moderate amounts of PPMPs significantly accelerated the<lb/> cell cycle of cancer cells and enhanced the secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the human breast cancer cell lines,<lb/> MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7; however, cellular migration and motility were not altered. In addition, our RNAseq<lb/> analysis revealed that PPMPs affected cancer cell-matrix adhesion and cell cycle-related signaling in human breast<lb/> cancer. Consequently, chronic exposure to PPMPs may increase the risk of cancer progression and metastasis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>Preparation of PPMPs. Polypropylene pellets (PPs) were purchased from the Namyang Corporation<lb/> (Korea). Pellets were crushed thoroughly by a cryogenic grinder. We used a 6875D Freezer/Mill (SPEX Sam-<lb/>plePrep, United States) at the National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management, Seoul National<lb/> University (Korea). Then, the powder from the crushed PPs was filtered and collected based on particle size<lb/> using a 100 μm-micropore nickel base sieve (Precision Eforming, United States).<lb/></p>

			<p>Particle size analysis. The particle size distribution plot of the PPs used in this study was calculated based<lb/> on the data from the particle size analyzer. We used a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern Panalytical, United Kingdom)<lb/> at the Center for Biotechnology Facilities, Chung-Ang University (Korea). The automatic dry dispersion method<lb/> was selected to detect the most pristine form of the MP particles.<lb/></p>

			<head>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</head>

			<p>The medium was replaced with medium with or without PPMPs<lb/> at 1.6 mg/ml, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 for 24 hours. Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline<lb/> (PBS) and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 1 hour. The cells underwent a graded ethanol<lb/> dehydration series (50, 75, 90, 95, 100%) for ten minutes each. Cells were subsequently immersed in a 1:1 etha-<lb/>nol/hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1:2 ethanol/HMDS, and 100% HMDS for 5 minutes<lb/> each. The samples were mounted on stubs, coated with a layer of platinum, and viewed using an S-3400N micro-<lb/>scope (Hitachi, Japan) at 10 kV.<lb/></p>

			<p>High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis. All<lb/> samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1260 infinity II high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array<lb/> detector (HPLC/DAD) system consisting of quaternary pumps (G7111A), a G7129A autosampler, a G7116A<lb/> column oven, and a G7115A diode array detector. Data analysis was performed by the Agilent openlab CDS<lb/> chemstation software (version: C.01.<ref type="biblio">10[201]</ref>). HPLC analysis was performed on an Eclipse XDB-C18 column<lb/> (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Isocratic elution was carried out using a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of 0.1%<lb/> acetic acid in water and 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile (a ratio of 70:30). The monitoring wavelength ranged<lb/> from 200 to 400 nm. Detection was performed using wavelengths of 210, 254, and 350 nm. An injection volume<lb/> of 10 μL was used. The total running time was 60 minutes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cell culture. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from the Ameri-<lb/>can Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco&apos;s modified essential medium<lb/> (DMEM, Welgene, Korea) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Abfrontier, Korea) and 1% penicil-<lb/>lin/streptomycin (Gibco, USA). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium<lb/> (RPMI) 1640 (Welgene, Korea) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 (v/v).<lb/> Sterilization was performed in consideration of the melting point of polypropylene (about 160 degrees). Before<lb/> the experiment, PPMPs were sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 minutes and UV treatment for 30 minutes.<lb/> Sterilized PPMPs were mixed with cell medium at a concentration of 1.6 mg/ml and sonicated for 30 minutes to<lb/> be added to the cell culture. The observed PPMPs did not aggregate together.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cell viability.</head>

			<p>Cell viability was assessed using the AlamarBlue assay kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the<lb/> manufacturer&apos;s instructions. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded onto 96-well culture plates (Thermo Fisher Scien-<lb/>tific, USA) at a density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. Various concentrations (0, 0.4,<lb/> 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 mg/ml) of PPMPs were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 24 hours. At the<lb/> end of the experiment, 10% (v/v) AlamarBlue solution was added to each well. After a 2-hour incubation, the<lb/> fluorescence intensity was measured by a Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader (Agilent Technologies, USA) at excita-<lb/>tion and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm, respectively. All assays were performed with three replicates.<lb/></p>

			<p>Time-lapse imaging. For the cell migration tracking experiments, a six-well plate (SPL, Korea) was placed<lb/> on an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon, Japan). The medium was replaced with medium with or without<lb/> PPMPs at 1.6 mg/ml, and then breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 motility was observed. Images<lb/> were recorded every three minutes for 6 hours in a chamber maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Cells were<lb/> tracked by time-lapse image sequences using the manual tracking plug-in for Image J (http:// rsb. info. nih. gov/ ij).<lb/> The Image J output was integrated into the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool software (ibidi GmbH, Germany) to<lb/> determine the migration position and velocity of the cells in each well. The total distances and average velocities<lb/> were obtained from 360 cells for each group (30 cells for each position, 4 positions per sample, 3 independent<lb/> experiments).<lb/></p>

			<p>Wound healing. For the wound healing migration assay, cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate and allowed<lb/> to grow to form a confluent monolayer. MDA-MB-213 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were wounded<lb/> with a 200 µL pipette tip. After wounding, the detached cells were removed, the medium was replaced with<lb/> culture media containing a vehicle or 1.6 mg/ml PPMPs, and cells were further incubated for 12 hours. Images<lb/> of the wound gap were monitored under a phase-contrast microscope (IX-81, Olympus, Japan), and the wound<lb/> closure was measured using Image J software (http:// rsb. info. nih. gov/ ij).<lb/></p>

			<head>RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.</head>

			<p>The RNA-seq library was generated using the TruSeq<lb/> mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Briefly, total RNA<lb/> (50 ng) from the MDA-MB-231 cells (which treated MP medium for 24 hours the previous day) was isolated, a 5&apos;<lb/> oligo-dT primer was hybridized to the RNA, and reverse transcription was carried out. Second-strand synthesis<lb/> was initiated with a random primer containing an Illumina-compatible linker sequence at its 5&apos; end. The double-<lb/>stranded library was purified with AMPure magnetic beads (A63881, Beckman coulter, CA, USA) to remove<lb/> all the reaction components. High-throughput sequencing was carried out as paired-end 101 sequencing reads<lb/> using a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, Inc., USA). mRNA-Seq reads were aligned using STAR-2.7.1a. The alignment<lb/> file was applied for assembling transcripts, estimating their abundances, and detecting the differential expression<lb/> of genes. We perform read feature counting with RNA-Seq by expectation-maximization (RSEM) (v.1.3.3), and<lb/> the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) were calculated using the FPKM<lb/> function from DESeq2 (v.1.32.0). The differential transcripts and genes expression were filtered by absolute log2<lb/> fold-change [log2 FC] &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.01 by edgeR (v.3.36.0). The significant DEGs/DETs were found by<lb/> more strict criteria abs(log2 FC &gt; 1.5) and p-value &lt; 0.01. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis were per-<lb/>formed by DAVID (PMID: 35325185).<lb/></p>

			<head>qRT-PCR.</head>

			<p>Total RNA was extracted from 8 × 10 5 of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells using the RNeasy Mini<lb/> kit (QIAGEN, Germany), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Reverse transcription of the RNA was<lb/> performed using the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for qRT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).<lb/> Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR<lb/> Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems) and StepOne Plus real-time PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). For cal-<lb/>culating the fold change, the cycle thresholds (Cts) were determined using the StepOne software v.2.3 (Applied<lb/> Biosystems), and mRNA expression was normalized to the GAPDH transcript and the control sample. The<lb/> primer sequences of the various genes were as follows: TMBIM6 (Forward: 5′-AGA GCT TCA GTG TGA GAG<lb/> GA-3′; Reverse: 5′-GCA GCT AAA TCA GAG GAC AG-3′), AP2M1 (Forward: 5′-CAA GCA AGA GCG GGA AGC<lb/> -3′; Reverse: 5′-CCA TCT GGC GGG ATA AAG C-3′), PTP4A2 (Forward: 5 GGA ATC CAC GTT CTA GAT TGGC-<lb/>3′; Reverse: 5′-AAC ACA GCA ACC TGG CTC TT-3′), FTH1 (Forward: 5′-CTC CTA CGT TTA CCT GTC CA-3′;<lb/> Reverse: 5′-CTC TCC CAG TCA TCA CAG TC-3′), and GAPDH (Forward: 5′-CAG CCT CAA GAT CAT CAG<lb/> CA-3′; Reverse: 5′-TGT GGT CAT GAG TCC TTC CA-3′).<lb/></p>

			<head>Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).</head>

			<p>Cells were seeded in 100 mm culture dishes at a density of 8 ×<lb/> 10 5 cells/ml, cultured until 90% confluence, and then replaced with or without PPMPs medium at a concentra-<lb/>tion of 1.6mg/ml. Following a 24-hour incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was collected and analyzed for IL-6<lb/> levels using the CymaxTM Human IL-6 enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) KIT (Abfrontier, Korea) follow-<lb/>ing the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cell-cycle progression with immunofluorescence/proliferation. The cell cycle analysis was per-<lb/>formed using a Premo FUCCI Cell Cycle Sensor BacMam 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). MCF-7 cells<lb/> were seeded on a six-well plate at a density of 10 4 cells per well. When the cells were completely attached, the<lb/> Premo™ reagent (geminin-GFP, Cdt1-RFP), at a volume of 20 particles per cell, was transduced into the cells.<lb/> After 16 hours of processing the Premo™ reagent, the media was replaced with a medium with or without 1.6mg/<lb/> ml PPMPs, and consecutive images were recorded every 5 minutes for 24 hours in a chamber maintained at<lb/> 37 °C with 5% CO 2 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis.</head>

			<p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 9 (GraphPad, Inc.,<lb/> USA). All data were reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and p-values were determined<lb/> using an unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant differences between the groups<lb/> were established at the following p-values: * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, and **** p &lt; 0.0001.<lb/> the morphology of the PPMP fragment types, and a variety of shapes were observed (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). The most frequent<lb/> size of the PPMP fragments was around 16.4 µm (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). We did not separate out the larger-sized PPMPs<lb/> (more than 20 µm) because MPs produced in the real world exist in various sizes and shapes, and humans do<lb/> not use different pathways to uptake the different sized and shaped PPMPs but indiscriminately uptake PPMPs<lb/> smaller than 200 µm in size. Therefore, we focused on studying MPs similar to what exists in the real world.<lb/></p>

			<p>Generally, plastic products contain artificial synthetic chemicals, such as processing aids, plasticizers, rein-<lb/>forcing agents, light stabilizers, oxidizing agents, flame retardants, and foaming agents. Therefore, we examined<lb/> the contribution of the chemicals leaked from the MPs used in this study. To evaluate these chemicals, we added<lb/> fragmented MPs to the complete medium and incubated them for 72 hours. We then detected the extracted<lb/> chemicals from the MPs using HPLC/DAD. There was no significant difference between the extracted chemicals<lb/> from the vehicle and MPs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). These results suggest that chemicals were not extracted from the MPs during<lb/> the incubation. Therefore, all the physiological observations in this study were effects of the MPs.<lb/></p>

			<p>PPMPs did not show cytotoxicity. In order to assess the cytotoxicity of the MPs, PPMPs were added<lb/> to MDA-MB-231 cells at various concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2 mg/ml). The cell viability was meas-<lb/></p>

(C) Comparison of the HPLC chromatograms before (left, Vehicle) and after the microplastic<lb/> treatment at the selective adsorptions (right, PPMP).<lb/></figure>

			<p>ured 24 hours after the administration of the PPMPs. The cell viability was not affected by the PPMP treat-<lb/>ment regardless of their concentration, suggesting that the PPMPs did not induce cytotoxicity in these breast<lb/> cancer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). For subsequent experiments in this study, we wanted to apply the highest concentration<lb/> of PPMPs that did not affect the viability of the MDA-MB-231 cells. Although the PPMP-induced toxicity was<lb/> not statistically significant, the cell viability was slightly decreased at 2.0 mg/ml (94.5%) compared with 1.6 mg/<lb/> ml (102.4%), so all subsequent experiments were performed using 1.6 mg/ml PPMPs. After adding 1.6 mg/ml<lb/> PPMPs for 24 hours, the cells were fixed and subjected to SEM imaging. PPMPs were sitting down to the surface<lb/> of cells or inserted between cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Altered cellular shape and morphology were not observed in the<lb/> ultrastructural analysis. Since most of the PPMPs tended to float in the medium when treated, small portion of<lb/> PPMPs were sunken to the cellular membrane or the bottom of the plate (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>PPMPs did not alter cellular motility in breast cancer cells. Cancer metastasis is associated with cel-<lb/>lular migration and motility. To investigate whether the PPMP exposure affected the migration of human breast<lb/> cancer cells, PPMPs were administered to hormone-dependent MCF-7 (ER+, PR+, HER2-) and hormone-inde-<lb/>pendent triple-negative MDA-MB-231 (ER-, PR-, HER2-) cells. The cell motility was observed by time-lapse<lb/> imaging over six hours. The plot shows the path and location of the cell movement by the line from the center<lb/> (0, 0) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The rates of 360 cells in each group were quantified and displayed in the graph. As a result, the<lb/> exposure to PPMPs in the MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect the direction and speed of the cancer cell motility.<lb/> These results were consistent in both the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A,B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Further, the wound-healing ability of both breast cancer cell types, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, was exam-<lb/>ined. The cell migration analysis was performed after exposing the cells to 1.6 mg/ml PPMPs for 12 hours.<lb/> Similarly, the presence of PPMPs did not alter the tendency of wound closure in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7<lb/> cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C,D</ref>). These results suggest that PPMP exposure does not affect cancer cell motility regardless of the<lb/> properties of the breast cancer cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>PPMPs induced transcriptional changes in RNA-seq analysis. An RNA-seq was performed on the<lb/> MDA-MB-231 cells with or without PPMP incubation to investigate whether the 1.6mg/ml PPMPs affected gene<lb/> expression related to breast cancer progression. After the read alignment and quantification, the initial evaluation<lb/> of the dataset was performed. Using 18,000 of the most expressed transcripts and a principal component analysis<lb/> (PCA) plot, we assessed the differences among the samples collected from cells with or without PPMPs (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).<lb/> The first and second principal components accounted for the largest variance among the datasets generated from<lb/> the RNA-Seq dataset. The application of EdgeR with conservative access to the RNA-seq data gained from the<lb/> PPMP-treated samples confirmed that there were 1717 differentially expressed transcripts (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). The volcano<lb/> plots show the statistical significance of the differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) with the respective fold-<lb/>changes (p &lt; 0.01, absolute log2 fold-change [log2 FC] &gt; 1) compared with the control group. The significant<lb/> upregulation (753 transcripts) or downregulation (964 transcripts) of genes was revealed in the PPMP-treated<lb/> breast cancer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). Hierarchical clustering of the upregulated (343) or downregulated (319) DETs<lb/> in the PPMP-treated cells were classified into two categories with stringent filtering conditions (p &lt; 0.01, log2<lb/> FC &gt; 1.5) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>). The top enriched gene ontology (GO) cellular components and biological processes of the<lb/> PPMP-exposed cells were visualized from the significant DETs of the upregulated genes as cluster 1 of Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>.<lb/> Following the GO enrichment analysis, the cell cycle, cell-matrix adhesion, adenylate cyclase activity, and fatty<lb/> acid metabolic processes were revealed to be the most significantly enriched pathways in the PPMP-treated cells<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4D</ref>). Among them, G1/S phase transition-related transcript levels were the most highly impacted by the<lb/> PPMP exposure. Thus, we evaluated the expression of cell cycle-related genes by qRT-PCR. The selected genes<lb/></p>

			<p>www.nature.com/scientificreports/<lb/> were analyzed from cells exposed to PPMPs for 24 hours. The expression of transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif<lb/> containing 6 (TMBIM6) was about 1.52-fold higher in cells treated with PPMPs than in the vehicle-treated cells<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4E</ref>). The expression of adaptor related protein complex 2 subunit mu 1 (AP2M1) was increased by about<lb/> 1.92-fold in cells treated with PPMPs. Also, the transcript level of protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A2 (PTP4A2)<lb/> was increased by about 1.46-fold in the PPMP-treated cells compared with the vehicle-treated cells. However,<lb/> the expression of the ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) was reduced by about 0.6-fold. These results show that the<lb/> expression of genes related to the cell cycle was affected by the PPMPs. Interestingly, these changes of gene<lb/> expression by PPMP were not observed in normal breast epithelial cells, MCF10A. PPMP incubation could only<lb/> affect breast cancer cells, not normal breast cell line (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/> Further, the cell cycle changes in breast cancer cells after exposure to PPMPs were monitored using FUCCI,<lb/> a cell cycle sensor, for 24 hours. Compared with the vehicle, the color change was accelerated by the PPMPs<lb/> from red, indicating G1 phase, to yellow, indicating early S phase (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>, the cell cycle phases are<lb/> expressed as percentages at six-hour intervals. After six hours of PPMP treatment, the proportion of cells in the<lb/> S/G2/M phase was increased, suggesting that PPMPs promote cell cycle changes in breast cancer.<lb/></p>

			<p>PPMPs increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from cancer cells. Cytokines<lb/> are important mediators in the tumor microenvironment and can function as growth factors to increase cell<lb/> metastasis by promoting extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis. In particular, IL-6 is a well-known<lb/> pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with the tumor microenvironment and has been reported to promote cell<lb/> cycle progression, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis in breast cancer <ref type="biblio">15-17</ref> . Since the PPMPs promoted<lb/> the cell cycle of breast cancer cells, we evaluated whether the secretion of IL-6 was increased in cancer cells<lb/> exposed to 1.6mg/ml PPMPs. After exposure to the PPMPs for 24 hours, the secretion of IL-6 was 34.62 ± 1.41<lb/> ng/ml, which was significantly increased compared with the vehicle in MDA-MB-231 cells (n = 3, 10.60 ± 3.38<lb/> ng/ml). Similarly, the secretion of IL-6 in the MCF-7 cells was also markedly increased in the PPMP group (5.36<lb/> ± 0.23 pg/ml) compared with the vehicle group (3.98 ± 0.13 pg/ml) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6A,B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>MPs are rapidly emerging as a global challenge that raises concerns about human health and the whole ecosys-<lb/>tem. In addition, the increased use of single-use plastics during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated an already<lb/> out-of-control global plastic waste problem.<lb/></p>

			<p>Most of the research on MPs is confined to the effect of the sphere type MPs; however, most of the MPs in the<lb/> environment are the fragment and fiber type MPs. Therefore, the results of studies on the sphere type MPs are<lb/> prone to provide biased information on the MP risk assessment to human health. To date, studies on the effect of<lb/> shape-dependent MPs are very limited. In this study, we focused on the pathophysiological effect of fragmented<lb/> MPs on cancer cell lines. The PPMPs used in this study were a mixture of fragmented PPMPs of various sizes,<lb/> but the majority had a diameter of 16.4 µm. We demonstrated that the fragmented PPMPs promoted the cell<lb/> cycle, proliferation, and secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in human breast cancer cells, while PPMPs<lb/> did not induce cytotoxicity nor enhance cellular motility.<lb/></p>

			<p>Various sized MPs can affect cells differently in vitro or in vivo. MPs are reported to have a wide range of sizes<lb/> in freshwater and marine environments, varying from 10 µm to 5 mm <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> . The tiniest MPs are called nanoplastics<lb/> and are smaller than 0.1 µm. The accumulation of plastic particles, between the sizes of 5 and 110 µm, in animals,<lb/> such as rats, dogs, and pigs, was reported as early as 1970 <ref type="biblio">20</ref> . Recently, several studies have reported how plastics<lb/> might be harmful in vitro and in vivo and that the size of the MPs determines their uptake efficiency through<lb/> the gastrointestinal, alveolar, and dermal epithelium <ref type="biblio">21-23</ref> . Although more than 90% of the MPs were reported<lb/> to be excreted in feces, especially larger particles (&gt; 150 µm), smaller MPs may be absorbed systematically. It<lb/> has been reported that MPs 0.1-10 µm in size can cross the blood-brain barrier <ref type="biblio">24</ref> and the placenta <ref type="biblio">25</ref> , particles<lb/> smaller than 150 µm can cross the gastrointestinal epithelium, and MPs smaller than 2.5 µm can enter the sys-<lb/>temic circulation system through endocytosis <ref type="biblio">26</ref> . Thus, the PPMPs in this study were small enough to cross the<lb/> gastrointestinal tract and travel through the body.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, we applied PPMPs. Polypropylene particles are thought to be harmless polymers according to<lb/> the guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <ref type="biblio">27</ref> ; however, some studies show that their toxicity is<lb/> mainly due to heat 28 and size <ref type="biblio">29</ref> . In this study, only a few portion of PPMPs among the 1.6 mg/ml of PPMPs were<lb/> sitting down to the cell surface or bottom of the culture plate (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), while most of the PPMPs were floating in<lb/> the medium. Moreover, our ultrastructural analysis showed that most of the PPMPs could not enter the cells.<lb/> Interestingly, the PPMPs sunken between the cell membrane or bottom of the plate did not interrupt the cellular<lb/> migration or motility of cancer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Instead, the PPMPs enhanced IL-6 secretion and the cell cycle of<lb/> breast cancer cells. Based on the GO of the DEGs from the RNA-seq analysis in our study, G1/S phase transition<lb/> and cell-matrix adhesion related pathways were activated (Fig. <ref type="figure">4D</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We also found<lb/> that the gene expression of TMBIM6, AP2M1, and PTP4A2, which are correlated with cancer progression and<lb/> the cell cycle <ref type="biblio">30-32</ref> , was significantly increased by PPMP incubation in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells,<lb/> suggesting that PPMPs regulate the transcriptional activity of cancer cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interestingly, chemical factors could not be detected in our system, although most of the PPMPs were floating<lb/> in the culture medium (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). In general, the chemical compounds from MPs, which are used in most plastic<lb/> processing, are also important factors to be considered. Manufacturers add compounds such as plasticizers,<lb/> stabilizers, and pigments to plastics and many of these substances are hazardous; for example, they can interfere<lb/> with the endocrine system <ref type="biblio">33</ref> . There are also studies showing that benzophenone-A, a plastic stabilizer, stimulates<lb/> the proliferation of ovarian cancer and breast cancer <ref type="biblio">34</ref> , and several other chemicals have been shown to have<lb/> various effects on cell cycle, proliferation, and the reproductive system <ref type="biblio">35,36</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the results in Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>, we concluded that the physical effect of PPMPs on the breast cell line drives<lb/> cancer progression rather than the chemical effect. PPMPs attached to the cell membrane or inserted between<lb/> cells may alter the physical contact or stimuli in human breast cancer cells, followed by the enhancement of<lb/> cancer progressions, such as the cell cycle and IL-6 secretion. However, the chemical effect of PPMPs cannot<lb/> be excluded. Since the cell culture medium is generally composed of a complement of amino acids, vitamins,<lb/></p>

(A) and (B) IL-6 secretion was<lb/> evaluated by an ELISA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (unpaired two-tailed t test, ***p &lt; 0.001,<lb/> n = 3 for the MDA-MB-231 cells; n = 6 for the MCF-7 cells).</figure>
