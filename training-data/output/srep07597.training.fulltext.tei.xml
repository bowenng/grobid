			<p>ydrogen is a globally accepted clean energy. The efficient and safe storage and release of hydrogen is the<lb/> major technical challenge of utilizing hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier 1,2 . Chemical storage materials<lb/> with high hydrogen content and low molecular weight are expected as potential hydrogen sources.<lb/> Particularly, boron-and nitrogen-(B-N) based compounds including ammonia borane (NH 3 BH 3 , AB) and hydra-<lb/>zine borane (N 2 H 4 BH 3 , HB) have received much attention <ref type="biblio">3-7</ref> . Ammonia borane, the simplest B-N compound, has<lb/> been an attractive candidate for chemical hydrogen storage material owing to its high hydrogen capacity (19.6 wt%)<lb/> and low formula weight (30.9 g/mol) <ref type="biblio">8-11</ref> . The closely related compound HB contains 15.4 wt% of hydrogen, which<lb/> is higher than the 2015 target of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) (9 wt% of hydrogen), and regards as another B-<lb/>N compound for chemical hydrogen storage application <ref type="biblio">12-14</ref> . In general, hydrogen stored in AB and HB can be<lb/> released through solvolysis (hydrolysis and methanolysis) in solution <ref type="biblio">8-18</ref> , and thermal dehydrogenation in solid<lb/> state <ref type="biblio">19,20</ref> . The recent studies in HB indicated that the extent of hydrogen generation can be increased up to 5 mol H 2<lb/> per mol HB via both hydrolysis of the group BH 3 and decomposition of the group of N 2 H 4 by using Ni-Pt and Ni-<lb/>Rh nanocatalysts at 323 K, which enhances the importance of the use of HB in the chemical hydrogen storage <ref type="biblio">21-25</ref> .<lb/> As the thermal dehydrogenation requires high temperature and power consumption, catalytic hydrolysis of AB and<lb/> HB has particularly attracted a great of research interests. In the presence of suitable catalysts, hydrolysis of AB<lb/> (eqn.1) and HB (eqn.2) can be achieved under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.<lb/></p>

			<p>So far, lots of metal-based catalysts have been tested for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB <ref type="biblio">26-41</ref> and<lb/> HB <ref type="biblio">12-14</ref> . Copper is an abundant element in the earth&apos;s crust. However, the Cu nanocatalysts are still not well-<lb/>pleasing for hydrolysis of AB and HB up to now <ref type="biblio">14,34-41</ref> . Therefore, it is<lb/> of profound interest to achieve the high activity and long reusability<lb/> of Cu nanocatalysts.<lb/></p>

			<p>For practical application, the synthesis of metal-based nanocata-<lb/>lyst is an important topic in heterogeneous catalysis. However, most<lb/> of these catalysts in nano-size are easily aggregated, leading to the loss<lb/> of the catalytic activity and reusability performance. In recent years,<lb/> synthesis of metal NPs into a porous material or within a core-shell<lb/> system has attracted much attention due to the possibility of obtain-<lb/>ing monodisperse and ultrafine metal NPs <ref type="biblio">42-52</ref> . Moreover, the<lb/> agglomerate of metal NPs can be avoided, even under harsh reaction<lb/> condition, because of the confinement effects in those materials <ref type="biblio">43-52</ref> .<lb/> Especially, metal NPs embedded in the silica shells have received<lb/> tremendous attention in many fields, such as catalysis <ref type="biblio">44-48</ref> , absor-<lb/>bents <ref type="biblio">49</ref> , drug delivery <ref type="biblio">50</ref> , photonics <ref type="biblio">51</ref> , and magnetics <ref type="biblio">52</ref> . Various<lb/> approaches have been used to synthesize such materials, however,<lb/> besides the tedious assembly procedures, the sizes of metal NPs in<lb/> silica shells are often limited by the pre-synthesized metal colloids<lb/> methods, resulting in the difficulty to prepare and assemble metal<lb/> core NPs smaller than 10 nm inside the silica nanoshell <ref type="biblio">53</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Herein, for the first time, we report a simple one-pot protocol for<lb/> preparing of ultrafine copper nanoparticles embedded in porous<lb/> silica nanospheres by a reverse micelle method under ambient atmo-<lb/>sphere at room temperature. The obtained core-shell nanospheres<lb/> can hinder the interaction between Cu NPs core and completely<lb/> avoid the Cu NPs aggregate through the protection of porous silica<lb/> shell. Especially, the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres show a<lb/> superior catalytic activity, in comparison to the commercial SiO 2<lb/> supported Cu NPs (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 ), SiO 2 nanospheres sup-<lb/>ported Cu NPs (Cu/SiO 2 ), and free Cu NPs for the hydrolytic dehy-<lb/>drogenation of AB and HB at room temperature. The activation<lb/> energy and reusability of the synthesized Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres for the hydrolysis of AB and HB have also been studied.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<p>The synthetic process for preparing Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres was illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Briefly, aqueous solution of<lb/> copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl 2 ?2H 2 O), a precursor for metal<lb/> nanoparticles, was first added into the cyclohexane solution of poly-<lb/>ethylene glycolmono-4-nonylphenyl ether (NP-5) in the step of<lb/> water-in-oil (w/o) reverse micelle formation <ref type="biblio">45-49</ref> . As shown in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the amount of CuCl 2 solution could be contained in micelle<lb/> particles. When tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was added to this<lb/> system, the hydrolysis of TEOS by aqueous NH 3 ?H 2 O would proceed<lb/> on the interface between water and oil, resulting in the encapsulation<lb/> of copper precursor in silica shell. After washing with methanol, the<lb/> copper precursor embedded in the SiO 2 nanospheres were reduced to<lb/> copper nanoparticles (Cu@SiO 2 ) using AB as a reducing agent.<lb/></p>

			<p>The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image for the Cu@SiO 2<lb/> nanospheres is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a,b</ref>). SEM images show that the Cu@<lb/> SiO 2 samples prepared by the one-pot synthetic route in a reverse<lb/> micelle system are quite uniform nanospheres. The morphology and<lb/> size of the obtained sample was further characterized by transmission<lb/> electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c,d,f</ref>), the sample<lb/> consists of uniform size and well-proportioned spherical particles, in<lb/> good agreement with SEM observation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a,b</ref>)). The core-shell<lb/> nanostructures of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 sample are easy to<lb/> distinguish that ultrafine Cu NPs (dark spots in Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>) with diameter<lb/> of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the center of well-pro-<lb/>portioned spherical SiO 2 NPs of about 25 nm in diameter, confirmed<lb/> by the HAADF-STEM observation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>). The EDX spectra of the<lb/> Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> shows the Ka peaks corresponding<lb/> to O (0.53 keV), Si (1.75 keV), Cu (0.93, 8.03, 8.92 keV) elements,<lb/> and Ni signals (7.49 keV) from the TEM grids. The EDX analysis<lb/> further confirms that monodisperse and ultrafine Cu NPs core is<lb/> embedded within the SiO 2 shell. In contrast, the large agglomerate/<lb/> aggregate Cu NPs were observed in Cu/Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 ,<lb/> and free Cu NPs (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which may lead to a decrease in the catalytic<lb/> activity and reusability (vide infra).<lb/></p>

			<p>The as-synthesized catalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray dif-<lb/>fraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the strong and broad peak in the<lb/> range of 2h 5 15-35u can be assigned to amorphous silica with no<lb/> diffraction peaks to Cu NPs, probably because Cu NPs within SiO 2<lb/> are too small (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and/or the Cu content is too low (2.2 wt%).<lb/> However, for Commercial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs and free Cu NPs<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), the diffraction peaks (2h) at 43.34u, 50.47u, and 74.17u are<lb/> attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Cu, respectively,<lb/> which can be indexed undisputedly to cubic Cu (JCPDS No. 04-<lb/>0836). Additionally, the XPS spectrum of Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres shows two prominent peaks at 932.5 and 952.5 eV which are<lb/> readily assigned to Cu2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), respectively,<lb/> indicating that Cu(II) NPs was reduced to Cu(0) NPs.<lb/></p>

			<p>A nitrogen adsorption-desorption study shows that the Brunauer-<lb/>Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the Cu@SiO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and Cu/<lb/> Commercial-SiO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>) are calculated to be 70.8 m 2 g 21 and<lb/> 139.8 m 2 g 21 , respectively. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the nitrogen adsorp-<lb/>tion-desorption isotherms of the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres displace a<lb/> type-IV curves with a small hysteresis loop occur at a relative pres-<lb/>sure of 0.8-1.0, indicating the existence of mesopores in the samples,<lb/> as evidenced by DFT pore diameter distribution (10 , 43 nm) in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>. These mesopores are likely due to the void spaces among the<lb/> stacked Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres. The DFT pore diameter distribution<lb/> of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref> also shows that there are micro-<lb/>pores (1.1 nm) on the SiO 2 shells of the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres.<lb/> These pores can provide the reactants readily access the Cu NPs core<lb/> and the products can easily exit through the pores.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The catalytic activity on the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) was<lb/> tested for the as-synthesized samples. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the time course<lb/> of the hydrogen evolution from the aqueous AB using the different<lb/> catalysts. It is observed that the hydrolysis reaction rate and amount<lb/> of hydrogen significantly depend on the catalysts. No hydrogen gen-<lb/>eration is observed for silica, suggesting that silica has no catalytic<lb/> activity for the hydrolysis of AB. The evolution of 3.0, 2.9, 3.0, and<lb/> 2.1 mol of hydrogen is completed in 10.3, 37.0, 66.0, and 170.0 min,<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1 | Experimental design. Schematic illustration of the synthesis of Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres.<lb/></figure>

			<p>respectively, in the presence of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/<lb/> Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs at room temperature.<lb/> The turnover frequency (TOF) values catalyzed by Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/<lb/> Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and Cu NPs are around 3.24, 0.87, 0.50,<lb/> and 0.14 mol H 2 mol Cu 21 min 21 , respectively. The catalytic activ-<lb/>ities are in the order of Cu@SiO 2 . Cu/Commercial SiO 2 . Cu/SiO 2<lb/> . Cu NPs. CO temperature programmed desorption (CO-TPD)<lb/> curves for Cu@SiO 2 and Cu/Commercial SiO 2 NPs shown in Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">S6</ref> reveal that the reactive surfaces of Cu are 9.46 and 1.31 m 2 g 21 ,<lb/> respectively, in line with the catalytic activity tests for the hydrolytic<lb/> dehydrogenation of AB and HB (vide infra). To the best of our<lb/> knowledge, the present Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres exhibit the second<lb/> highest activity among the Cu nanocatalysts ever reported for hydro-<lb/>lytic dehydrogenation of AB (See Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Although the activity of<lb/> Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres is slightly lower than that of our previous<lb/> reported catalysts Cu/RGO (3.61) <ref type="biblio">37</ref> , the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres show<lb/> a much better reusability than Cu/RGO (vide infra). The excellent<lb/> catalytic performance of the Cu@SiO 2 nanocatalysts can be attribu-<lb/>ted to the ultrafine and monodisperse Cu NPs within the porous<lb/> silica shells, which can hinder Cu NPs cores from undergoing<lb/> deformation or aggregation during the hydrolysis reaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to get the activation energy (E a ) of AB catalyzed by Cu@<lb/> SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres, the hydrolysis reactions at different<lb/> temperatures were carried out. Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref> shows mol H 2 /mol AB<lb/> vs. reaction time in the hydrolysis of AB (0.2 M, 5 mL) catalyzed<lb/> by Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres at various temperatures in the range of<lb/> 298-316 K. The hydrogen generation rate increases by increasing<lb/> the reaction temperature as expected. The values of reaction rate<lb/> constant k at different temperatures are measured from the slope<lb/> of the linear part of each plot in Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>. The Arrhenius plot of lnk<lb/> versus 1/T for the catalyst is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>. From the slop of the<lb/> straight line, the activation energy for the hydrolysis of AB in the<lb/> presence of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres is determined to be approxi-<lb/>mately 36 6 1 kJ mol <ref type="biblio">21</ref> , being lower than most of the reported<lb/> values, indicating the superior catalytic performance of the catalysts<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) 9,35,37,48,54-59 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">2 | (a,b) SEM, (c,d,f</ref>) TEM and (e) HAADF-STEM images of the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3 | Representative TEM images of the (a,b) Cu/Commercial SiO 2 , (c,d) 2 , and (e,f) free Cu NPs.<lb/> Figure 4 | Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for the (a) Cu@SiO 2 , (b) Cu/<lb/> Commercial SiO 2 , and (c) free Cu NPs.<lb/> Figure 5 | Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the Cu@SiO 2<lb/> core-shell nanospheres.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The catalytic performance of Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/commercial SiO 2 , Cu/<lb/> SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs were also investigated the hydrolysis of<lb/> HB. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, the trends observed for the catalytic hydro-<lb/>lysis of HB by the different catalysts are similar as that for the hydro-<lb/>lysis reaction of AB. The evolution of 3.0, 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mol of<lb/> hydrogen is finished in 4.4, 7.5, 9.2, and 47.5 min, respectively, in the<lb/> presence of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/<lb/> SiO 2 and free Cu NPs at room temperature. The Cu@SiO 2 core-shell<lb/> nanospheres show a superior activity as compared to Cu/commercial<lb/> SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs for the catalytic hydrolysis of HB.<lb/> The TOF and activation energy of Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres<lb/> for the hydrolysis of HB are estimated to be 7.58 mol H 2 mol Cu 21<lb/> min 21 and 51 6 2 kJ/mol (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>), respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>Reusability of catalysts is very important for the practical applica-<lb/>tion. In this sense, the recycle test of the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres for the hydrolysis of AB and HB were carried out. As shown<lb/> in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, the catalytic activity of Cu@SiO 2 in the hydrolysis of AB and<lb/> HB retain 90 and 85% of their initial activity with a complete release<lb/> of hydrogen by hydrolysis reaction eqn.1 and 2 respectively, even at<lb/> the tenth recycles, indicating that the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres have a good durability in the catalytic reactions. In contrast,<lb/> the catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of AB and HB show a signifi-<lb/>cant decrease in the presence of the commercial SiO 2 supported Cu<lb/> NPs after three runs (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>), probably because the Cu NPs sup-<lb/>ported on the surface of silica are easily aggregated and then resulting<lb/> in lose the activity site in the recycling process. After cycle tests, ICP<lb/> analysis revealed that the copper leaching from Cu@SiO 2 and Cu/<lb/> commercial SiO 2 were 0.1 and 7.0% of total copper, respectively. The<lb/> results reveal that the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanosphere can effectively<lb/> prevent the leaching of Cu metal, thus making Cu@SiO 2 be an excel-<lb/>lent catalyst with high catalytic activity and good reusability. This<lb/> prominent feature can also be evidenced by TEM. Comparing with<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the morphology and the size of the spherical silica nanospheres<lb/> for Cu@SiO 2 after the catalytic reaction (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) shows no obvious<lb/> changes before and after catalytic hydrolysis reaction. The size of the<lb/> Cu NPs embedded in the SiO 2 spheres almost kept unchanged after<lb/> catalytic reaction. In addition, a high temperature, 573 K, was used<lb/> for heat treatment to prepare Cu@SiO 2 -573 K. The Cu@SiO 2 -573 K<lb/> with heat treatment still remain high activity, which release a stoi-<lb/>chiometric amount of H 2 from aqueous AB and HB (H 2 /(AB or HB)<lb/> 5 3) in 12.5 and 5.9 min, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">S10</ref> &amp; S11), indicating<lb/> that the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres have good thermal stability.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, for the first time, we have developed a facile one-pot<lb/> synthetic route to synthesis of ultrafine copper NPs within porous<lb/> silica nanospheres under ambient conditions. The TEM reveals that<lb/> ultrafine Cu NPs of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the<lb/> center of porous silica nanospheres. The core-shell Cu@SiO 2 NPs<lb/> show a much better catalytic activity, in comparison to the commer-<lb/>cial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs, SiO 2 supported nanospheres Cu NPs,<lb/> and free Cu NPs for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB at<lb/> room temperature. The TOF for Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in the hydro-<lb/>lytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB are measured to be 3.24 and<lb/> 7.58 mol H 2 mol Cu 21 min 21 , respectively. Moreover, the complete<lb/> release of hydrogen is achieved even in the tenth run, and the Cu@<lb/> SiO 2 nanospheres preserve 90 and 85% of their initial catalytic activ-<lb/>ity for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB, respectively,<lb/> indicating that the catalyst has a good reusability. The high perform-<lb/>ance and cost-effective catalyst may strongly encourage the practical<lb/> application of AB and HB as promising hydrogen storage materials.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nanchang Chemical Works, .99.5%), commercial SiO 2 (specific surface area 5<lb/> 200 m 2 g 21 ), 99.8%), sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 , Aldrich, 99%),<lb/> hydrazine hemisulfate ((N 2 H 4 ) 2 ?H 2 SO 4 ), and n-pentane were used without further<lb/> purification. Ultrapure water with the specific resistance of 18.3 MV?cm was<lb/> obtained by reversed osmosis followed by ion exchange and filtration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Instrumentation. The microstructure of the samples were investigated using a<lb/> transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with an energy-<lb/>dispersive X-ray detector (EDX). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was<lb/> taken on a SU8020 cold field-emission instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)<lb/> studies were performed on a Rigaku RINT-2200 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka<lb/> source (40 kV, 20 mA). The weight content of copper in Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres was<lb/> analyzed by means of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrophotometer<lb/> (Varian, 725-ES). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was performed with a<lb/> Thermo ESCALAB 250 multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer by using an<lb/> Al Ka source. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out on a<lb/> Micromeritics ASAP 2050 system at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore size<lb/> distribution were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation and<lb/> density functional theory (DFT) method, respectively. Temperature programmed<lb/> desorption (TPD) experiments were measured on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920<lb/> system, and the active surface area (S Cu ) was obtained by CO chemisorption on the<lb/> same instrument. The purity of the obtained HB was determined by Bruker 400 M<lb/> liquid NMR using CD 3 CN as solvent.<lb/></p>

			<p>Synthesis of ultrafine copper NPs within porous silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ).<lb/> Ultrafine copper NPs within silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ) were synthesized via a<lb/> one-pot synthetic route in a reversed micelle system according to the literature<lb/> procedure <ref type="biblio">45-49</ref> . Briefly, calculated amount of aqueous solution of CuCl 2 ?2H 2 O<lb/> (2.16 mL, 0.12 M) were rapidly injected into 480 mL of NP-5 (20.16 g) cyclohexane<lb/> solution. After stirring at room temperature for about 15 h, an aqueous ammonia<lb/> solution (28 wt%, 2.16 mL) was injected rapidly and after 2 h, TEOS (2.49 mL) was<lb/> added rapidly. The solution was stirred for 2 days at room temperature. The Cu(II)@<lb/> SiO 2 nanospheres were isolated by addition of methanol to destabilize the reversed-<lb/>micelle system and centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 8 min. The product obtained was<lb/> further washed with cyclohexane and acetone. After drying in vacuum oven at 313 K<lb/> overnight, the Cu(II)@SiO 2 nanospheres were further reduced by 5 mL of aqueous<lb/> AB solution (AB: 0.2 M, Cu/AB 5 0.09). The solids obtained were used as the as-<lb/>synthesized Cu@SiO 2 catalysts. The copper content of the product was analyzed by<lb/> ICP and calculated to be 2.2 wt%. For thermal stability, the Cu(II)@SiO 2 nanospheres<lb/> were calcined at 573 K for 5 h in air, reduced by AB (0.2 M, 5 mL), and label as Cu@<lb/> SiO 2 -573 K.<lb/></p>

			<p>Synthesis of copper NPs supported on silica (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 and Cu/SiO 2 ).<lb/> The copper NPs supported on commercial silica (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 ) and silica<lb/> nanospheres (Cu/SiO 2 ) in this study were prepared by the conventional impregnation<lb/> and subsequent AB reduction (0.2 M, 5 mL). The Cu content was kept to be about<lb/> 2.2 wt% and the molar ratio of Cu to AB was kept a constant of 0.09. Silica<lb/> nanospheres, which were prepared using a similar method as for the Cu/@SiO 2<lb/> nanospheres without copper precursor, were used as the support for preparing silica<lb/> nanospheres supported copper NPs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Synthesis of free copper NPs without silica (Cu NPs). The copper NPs without silica<lb/> were prepared in situ synthesis method. 15.5 mg CuCl 2 ?2H 2 O was dissolved in 5 mL<lb/> of distilled water and 34.3 mg of AB (Cu/AB 5 0.09) was added into the solution with<lb/> shaking.<lb/></p>

			<p>Synthesis of hydrazine borane (N 2 H 4 BH 3 , HB). Hydrazine borane was synthesized<lb/> by the method reported in literature <ref type="biblio">60</ref> . The detailed experimental process could be<lb/> found in the Supplementary material.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB. Typically, ammonia borane (NH 3 BH 3 ,<lb/> AB, 1 mmol) or hydrazine borane (N 2 H 4 BH 3 , HB, 1 mmol), and catalysts was placed<lb/> in a two-necked round-bottomed flask. One neck of the flask was connected to a gas<lb/> burette to measure the volume of hydrogen. The reaction started when 5 mL distilled<lb/> water was injected into the mixture using a syringe and the evolution of gas was<lb/> monitored using the gas burette. The reaction was completed when there was no more<lb/> gas generation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recycle test of Cu@SiO 2 for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB. After the<lb/> first run of hydrogen generation reaction was completed, the catalyst was separated<lb/> from the reaction solution by centrifugation and washed with water for several times.<lb/> The washed catalyst was then re-dispersed in 5 mL of water in a flask, and another<lb/> equivalent of AB or HB (1 mmol) was subsequently added to the reaction system and<lb/> the released gas was monitored by the gas burette. The reactions were repeated 10<lb/> times under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. After cycle tests, the catalysts<lb/> were separated from the reaction solution by centrifugation, washed with water for<lb/> several times and dried in vacuum oven at 313 K overnight.<lb/></p>
