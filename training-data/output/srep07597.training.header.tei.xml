	<div type="abstract">Ultrafine copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) within porous silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ) were prepared via a<lb/> simple one-pot synthetic route in a reverse micelle system and characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, N 2<lb/> adsorption-desorption, CO-TPD, XPS, and ICP methods. The characterized results show that ultrafine Cu<lb/> NPs with diameter of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the center of well-proportioned spherical<lb/> SiO 2 NPs of about 25 nm in diameter. Compared to commercial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs, SiO 2 nanospheres<lb/> supported Cu NPs, and free Cu NPs, the synthesized core-shell nanospheres Cu@SiO 2 exhibit a superior<lb/> catalytic activity for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB, NH 3 BH 3 ) and hydrazine<lb/> borane (HB, N 2 H 4 BH 3 ) under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The turnover frequencies (TOF)<lb/> for the hydrolysis of AB and HB in the presence of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres were measured to be 3.24 and<lb/> 7.58 mol H 2 (mol Cu min) 21 , respectively, relatively high values for Cu nanocatalysts in the same reaction.<lb/> In addition, the recycle tests show that the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres are still highly active in the hydrolysis of<lb/> AB and HB, preserving 90 and 85% of their initial catalytic activity even after ten recycles, respectively.</div>
