	<div type="abstract">Microplastics (MPs) are now a global issue due to increased plastic production and use. Recently,<lb/> various studies have been performed in response to the human health risk assessment. However,<lb/> these studies have focused on spherical MPs, which have smooth edges and a spherical shape and<lb/> account for less than 1% of MPs in nature. Unfortunately, studies on fragment-type MPs are very<lb/> limited and remain in the initial stages. In this study, we studied the effect that 16.4 µm fragment<lb/> type polypropylene (PP) MPs, which have an irregular shape and sharp edges and form naturally in<lb/> the environment, had on breast cancer. The detrimental effects of PPMPs on breast cancer metastasis<lb/> were examined. Here, 1.6 mg/ml of PPMP, which does not induce cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231, was<lb/> used, and at this concentration, PPMP did not induce morphological changes or cellular migrating<lb/> in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. However, PPMP incubation for 24 hours in the MDA-MB-231<lb/> cells significantly altered the level of cell cycle-related transcripts in an RNA-seq analysis. When<lb/> confirmed by qRT-PCR, the gene expression of TMBIM6, AP2M1, and PTP4A2 was increased, while the<lb/> transcript level of FTH1 was decreased. Further, secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from<lb/> cancer cells was elevated with the incubation of PPMP for 12 hours. These results suggest that PPMP<lb/> enhances metastasis-related gene expression and cytokines in breast cancer cells, exacerbating breast<lb/> cancer metastasis.<lb/> Abbreviations<lb/> MP<lb/> Microplastic<lb/> SEM<lb/> Scanning electron microscopy<lb/> PBS<lb/> Phosphate buffered saline<lb/> HMDS<lb/> Hexamethyldisilazane<lb/> HPLC/DAD High-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector<lb/> qRT-PCR<lb/> Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction<lb/> ELISA<lb/> Enzyme-linked immunoassay<lb/> ER<lb/> Estrogen receptor<lb/> PR<lb/> Progesterone receptor<lb/> HER2<lb/> Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2<lb/> Microplastics (MPs) are typically less than 5 mm in size and are not only derived from the degradation of plastic<lb/> objects in the environment but are also produced for commercial uses 1,2 . Recently, MPs have been deemed a<lb/> new environmental pollutant due to their increased production and extremely low natural biodegradation in<lb/> the ecosystem 3 . There are increasing reports of MPs in drinking water and food products, including sea salt, due<lb/> to their broad range in shape and size and the number of polymers in the oceans and freshwater ecosystems 4-6 .<lb/> Importantly, MPs can enter the human body via the accumulation of MPs in the food chain. It was reported that<lb/> MPs had been detected in the gastrointestinal tract of marine animals and human tissue and organs 7,8 .</div>
