			<front>One-pot synthesis of core-shell Cu@SiO 2 <lb/>nanospheres and their catalysis for <lb/>hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia <lb/>borane and hydrazine borane <lb/>Qilu Yao 1 , Zhang-Hui Lu 1 , Zhujun Zhang 1 , Xiangshu Chen 1 &amp; Yaqian Lan 2 <lb/>1 Jiangxi Inorganic Membrane Materials Engineering Research Centre, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Jiangxi <lb/>Normal University, Nanchang 330022, China, 2 Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Biofunctional Materials, College of Chemistry and <lb/>Materials Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, China. <lb/>Ultrafine copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) within porous silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ) were prepared via a <lb/>simple one-pot synthetic route in a reverse micelle system and characterized by SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, N 2 <lb/>adsorption-desorption, CO-TPD, XPS, and ICP methods. The characterized results show that ultrafine Cu <lb/>NPs with diameter of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the center of well-proportioned spherical <lb/>SiO 2 NPs of about 25 nm in diameter. Compared to commercial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs, SiO 2 nanospheres <lb/>supported Cu NPs, and free Cu NPs, the synthesized core-shell nanospheres Cu@SiO 2 exhibit a superior <lb/>catalytic activity for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB, NH 3 BH 3 ) and hydrazine <lb/>borane (HB, N 2 H 4 BH 3 ) under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The turnover frequencies (TOF) <lb/>for the hydrolysis of AB and HB in the presence of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres were measured to be 3.24 and <lb/>7.58 mol H 2 (mol Cu min) 21 , respectively, relatively high values for Cu nanocatalysts in the same reaction. <lb/>In addition, the recycle tests show that the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres are still highly active in the hydrolysis of <lb/>AB and HB, preserving 90 and 85% of their initial catalytic activity even after ten recycles, respectively. <lb/></front>

			<body>H <lb/>ydrogen is a globally accepted clean energy. The efficient and safe storage and release of hydrogen is the <lb/>major technical challenge of utilizing hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier 1,2 . Chemical storage materials <lb/>with high hydrogen content and low molecular weight are expected as potential hydrogen sources. <lb/>Particularly, boron-and nitrogen-(B-N) based compounds including ammonia borane (NH 3 BH 3 , AB) and hydra-<lb/>zine borane (N 2 H 4 BH 3 , HB) have received much attention 3-7 . Ammonia borane, the simplest B-N compound, has <lb/>been an attractive candidate for chemical hydrogen storage material owing to its high hydrogen capacity (19.6 wt%) <lb/>and low formula weight (30.9 g/mol) 8-11 . The closely related compound HB contains 15.4 wt% of hydrogen, which <lb/>is higher than the 2015 target of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) (9 wt% of hydrogen), and regards as another B-<lb/>N compound for chemical hydrogen storage application 12-14 . In general, hydrogen stored in AB and HB can be <lb/>released through solvolysis (hydrolysis and methanolysis) in solution 8-18 , and thermal dehydrogenation in solid <lb/>state 19,20 . The recent studies in HB indicated that the extent of hydrogen generation can be increased up to 5 mol H 2 <lb/>per mol HB via both hydrolysis of the group BH 3 and decomposition of the group of N 2 H 4 by using Ni-Pt and Ni-<lb/>Rh nanocatalysts at 323 K, which enhances the importance of the use of HB in the chemical hydrogen storage 21-25 . <lb/>As the thermal dehydrogenation requires high temperature and power consumption, catalytic hydrolysis of AB and <lb/>HB has particularly attracted a great of research interests. In the presence of suitable catalysts, hydrolysis of AB <lb/>(eqn.1) and HB (eqn.2) can be achieved under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. <lb/>NH 3 BH 3 z2H 2 O?NH 4 BO 2 z3H 2 <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>N 2 H 4 BH 3 z2H 2 O?N 2 H 5 BO 2 z3H 2 <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>So far, lots of metal-based catalysts have been tested for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB 26-41 and <lb/>HB 12-14 .

			<body>pleasing for hydrolysis of AB and HB up to now 14,34-41 . Therefore, it is <lb/>of profound interest to achieve the high activity and long reusability <lb/>of Cu nanocatalysts. <lb/>For practical application, the synthesis of metal-based nanocata-<lb/>lyst is an important topic in heterogeneous catalysis. However, most <lb/>of these catalysts in nano-size are easily aggregated, leading to the loss <lb/>of the catalytic activity and reusability performance. In recent years, <lb/>synthesis of metal NPs into a porous material or within a core-shell <lb/>system has attracted much attention due to the possibility of obtain-<lb/>ing monodisperse and ultrafine metal NPs 42-52 . Moreover, the <lb/>agglomerate of metal NPs can be avoided, even under harsh reaction <lb/>condition, because of the confinement effects in those materials 43-52 . <lb/>Especially, metal NPs embedded in the silica shells have received <lb/>tremendous attention in many fields, such as catalysis 44-48 , absor-<lb/>bents 49 , drug delivery 50 , photonics 51 , and magnetics 52 . Various <lb/>approaches have been used to synthesize such materials, however, <lb/>besides the tedious assembly procedures, the sizes of metal NPs in <lb/>silica shells are often limited by the pre-synthesized metal colloids <lb/>methods, resulting in the difficulty to prepare and assemble metal <lb/>core NPs smaller than 10 nm inside the silica nanoshell 53 . <lb/>Herein, for the first time, we report a simple one-pot protocol for <lb/>preparing of ultrafine copper nanoparticles embedded in porous <lb/>silica nanospheres by a reverse micelle method under ambient atmo-<lb/>sphere at room temperature. The obtained core-shell nanospheres <lb/>can hinder the interaction between Cu NPs core and completely <lb/>avoid the Cu NPs aggregate through the protection of porous silica <lb/>shell. Especially, the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres show a <lb/>superior catalytic activity, in comparison to the commercial SiO 2 <lb/>supported Cu NPs (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 ), SiO 2 nanospheres sup-<lb/>ported Cu NPs (Cu/SiO 2 ), and free Cu NPs for the hydrolytic dehy-<lb/>drogenation of AB and HB at room temperature. The activation <lb/>energy and reusability of the synthesized Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres for the hydrolysis of AB and HB have also been studied. <lb/>Results <lb/>The synthetic process for preparing Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres was illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, aqueous solution of <lb/>copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl 2 ?2H 2 O), a precursor for metal <lb/>nanoparticles, was first added into the cyclohexane solution of poly-<lb/>ethylene glycolmono-4-nonylphenyl ether (NP-5) in the step of <lb/>water-in-oil (w/o) reverse micelle formation 45-49 . As shown in <lb/>Figure 1, the amount of CuCl 2 solution could be contained in micelle <lb/>particles. When tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was added to this <lb/>system, the hydrolysis of TEOS by aqueous NH 3 ?H 2 O would proceed <lb/>on the interface between water and oil, resulting in the encapsulation <lb/>of copper precursor in silica shell. After washing with methanol, the <lb/>copper precursor embedded in the SiO 2 nanospheres were reduced to <lb/>copper nanoparticles (Cu@SiO 2 ) using AB as a reducing agent. <lb/>The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image for the Cu@SiO 2 <lb/>nanospheres is shown in Fig. 2(a,b). SEM images show that the Cu@ <lb/>SiO 2 samples prepared by the one-pot synthetic route in a reverse <lb/>micelle system are quite uniform nanospheres. The morphology and <lb/>size of the obtained sample was further characterized by transmission <lb/>electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2(c,d,f), the sample <lb/>consists of uniform size and well-proportioned spherical particles, in <lb/>good agreement with SEM observation (Fig. 2(a,b)). The core-shell <lb/>nanostructures of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 sample are easy to <lb/>distinguish that ultrafine Cu NPs (dark spots in Fig. 2f) with diameter <lb/>of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the center of well-pro-<lb/>portioned spherical SiO 2 NPs of about 25 nm in diameter, confirmed <lb/>by the HAADF-STEM observation (Fig. 2e). The EDX spectra of the <lb/>Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in Fig. S2 shows the Ka peaks corresponding <lb/>to O (0.53 keV), Si (1.75 keV), Cu (0.93, 8.03, 8.92 keV) elements, <lb/>and Ni signals (7.49 keV) from the TEM grids. The EDX analysis <lb/>further confirms that monodisperse and ultrafine Cu NPs core is <lb/>embedded within the SiO 2 shell. In contrast, the large agglomerate/ <lb/>aggregate Cu NPs were observed in Cu/Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , <lb/>and free Cu NPs (Fig. 3), which may lead to a decrease in the catalytic <lb/>activity and reusability (vide infra). <lb/>The as-synthesized catalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray dif-<lb/>fraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 4, the strong and broad peak in the <lb/>range of 2h 5 15-35u can be assigned to amorphous silica with no <lb/>diffraction peaks to Cu NPs, probably because Cu NPs within SiO 2 <lb/>are too small (Fig. 2) and/or the Cu content is too low (2.2 wt%). <lb/>However, for Commercial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs and free Cu NPs <lb/>(Fig. 4), the diffraction peaks (2h) at 43.34u, 50.47u, and 74.17u are <lb/>attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Cu, respectively, <lb/>which can be indexed undisputedly to cubic Cu (JCPDS No. 04-<lb/>0836). Additionally, the XPS spectrum of Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres shows two prominent peaks at 932.5 and 952.5 eV which are <lb/>readily assigned to Cu2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (Fig. 2), respectively, <lb/>indicating that Cu(II) NPs was reduced to Cu(0) NPs. <lb/>A nitrogen adsorption-desorption study shows that the Brunauer-<lb/>Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the Cu@SiO 2 (Fig. 5) and Cu/ <lb/>Commercial-SiO 2 (Fig. S4) are calculated to be 70.8 m 2 g 21 and <lb/>139.8 m 2 g 21 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the nitrogen adsorp-<lb/>tion-desorption isotherms of the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres displace a <lb/>type-IV curves with a small hysteresis loop occur at a relative pres-<lb/>sure of 0.8-1.0, indicating the existence of mesopores in the samples, <lb/>as evidenced by DFT pore diameter distribution (10 , 43 nm) in <lb/>Fig. S5. These mesopores are likely due to the void spaces among the <lb/>stacked Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres. The DFT pore diameter distribution <lb/>of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in Fig. S5 also shows that there are micro-<lb/>pores (1.1 nm) on the SiO 2 shells of the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres. <lb/>These pores can provide the reactants readily access the Cu NPs core <lb/>and the products can easily exit through the pores. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The catalytic activity on the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) was <lb/>tested for the as-synthesized samples. Figure 6 shows the time course <lb/>of the hydrogen evolution from the aqueous AB using the different <lb/>catalysts. It is observed that the hydrolysis reaction rate and amount <lb/>of hydrogen significantly depend on the catalysts. No hydrogen gen-<lb/>eration is observed for silica, suggesting that silica has no catalytic <lb/>activity for the hydrolysis of AB. The evolution of 3.0, 2.9, 3.0, and <lb/>2.1 mol of hydrogen is completed in 10.3, 37.0, 66.0, and 170.0 min, <lb/>Figure 1 | Experimental design.

			<body>respectively, in the presence of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/ <lb/>Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs at room temperature. <lb/>The turnover frequency (TOF) values catalyzed by Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/ <lb/>Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and Cu NPs are around 3.24, 0.87, 0.50, <lb/>and 0.14 mol H 2 mol Cu 21 min 21 , respectively. The catalytic activ-<lb/>ities are in the order of Cu@SiO 2 . Cu/Commercial SiO 2 . Cu/SiO 2 <lb/>. Cu NPs. CO temperature programmed desorption (CO-TPD) <lb/>curves for Cu@SiO 2 and Cu/Commercial SiO 2 NPs shown in Fig. <lb/>S6 reveal that the reactive surfaces of Cu are 9.46 and 1.31 m 2 g 21 , <lb/>respectively, in line with the catalytic activity tests for the hydrolytic <lb/>dehydrogenation of AB and HB (vide infra). To the best of our <lb/>knowledge, the present Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres exhibit the second <lb/>highest activity among the Cu nanocatalysts ever reported for hydro-<lb/>lytic dehydrogenation of AB (See Table S1). Although the activity of <lb/>Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres is slightly lower than that of our previous <lb/>reported catalysts Cu/RGO (3.61) 37 , the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres show <lb/>a much better reusability than Cu/RGO (vide infra). The excellent <lb/>catalytic performance of the Cu@SiO 2 nanocatalysts can be attribu-<lb/>ted to the ultrafine and monodisperse Cu NPs within the porous <lb/>silica shells, which can hinder Cu NPs cores from undergoing <lb/>deformation or aggregation during the hydrolysis reaction. <lb/>In order to get the activation energy (E a ) of AB catalyzed by Cu@ <lb/>SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres, the hydrolysis reactions at different <lb/>temperatures were carried out. Figure 7a shows mol H 2 /mol AB <lb/>vs. reaction time in the hydrolysis of AB (0.2 M, 5 mL) catalyzed <lb/>by Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres at various temperatures in the range of <lb/>298-316 K. The hydrogen generation rate increases by increasing <lb/>the reaction temperature as expected. The values of reaction rate <lb/>constant k at different temperatures are measured from the slope <lb/>of the linear part of each plot in Fig. 7a. The Arrhenius plot of lnk <lb/>versus 1/T for the catalyst is plotted in Fig. 7b. From the slop of the <lb/>straight line, the activation energy for the hydrolysis of AB in the <lb/>presence of Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres is determined to be approxi-<lb/>mately 36 6 1 kJ mol 21 , being lower than most of the reported <lb/>values, indicating the superior catalytic performance of the catalysts <lb/>(Table 1) 9,35,37,48,54-59 . <lb/>Figure 2 | (a,b) SEM, (c,d,f) TEM and (e) HAADF-STEM images of the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres. <lb/></body>

			<body>The catalytic performance of Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/commercial SiO 2 , Cu/ <lb/>SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs were also investigated the hydrolysis of <lb/>HB. As shown in Fig. 8, the trends observed for the catalytic hydro-<lb/>lysis of HB by the different catalysts are similar as that for the hydro-<lb/>lysis reaction of AB. The evolution of 3.0, 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mol of <lb/>hydrogen is finished in 4.4, 7.5, 9.2, and 47.5 min, respectively, in the <lb/>presence of the as-synthesized Cu@SiO 2 , Cu/Commercial SiO 2 , Cu/ <lb/>SiO 2 and free Cu NPs at room temperature. The Cu@SiO 2 core-shell <lb/>nanospheres show a superior activity as compared to Cu/commercial <lb/>SiO 2 , Cu/SiO 2 , and free Cu NPs for the catalytic hydrolysis of HB. <lb/>The TOF and activation energy of Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanospheres <lb/>for the hydrolysis of HB are estimated to be 7.58 mol H 2 mol Cu 21 <lb/>min 21 and 51 6 2 kJ/mol (Fig. S7), respectively. <lb/>Reusability of catalysts is very important for the practical applica-<lb/>tion. In this sense, the recycle test of the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres for the hydrolysis of AB and HB were carried out. As shown <lb/>in Fig. 9, the catalytic activity of Cu@SiO 2 in the hydrolysis of AB and <lb/>HB retain 90 and 85% of their initial activity with a complete release <lb/>of hydrogen by hydrolysis reaction eqn.1 and 2 respectively, even at <lb/>the tenth recycles, indicating that the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nano-<lb/>spheres have a good durability in the catalytic reactions. In contrast, <lb/>the catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of AB and HB show a signifi-<lb/>cant decrease in the presence of the commercial SiO 2 supported Cu <lb/>NPs after three runs (Fig. S8), probably because the Cu NPs sup-<lb/>ported on the surface of silica are easily aggregated and then resulting <lb/>in lose the activity site in the recycling process. After cycle tests, ICP <lb/>analysis revealed that the copper leaching from Cu@SiO 2 and Cu/ <lb/>commercial SiO 2 were 0.1 and 7.0% of total copper, respectively. The <lb/>results reveal that the Cu@SiO 2 core-shell nanosphere can effectively <lb/>prevent the leaching of Cu metal, thus making Cu@SiO 2 be an excel-<lb/>lent catalyst with high catalytic activity and good reusability. This <lb/>prominent feature can also be evidenced by TEM. Comparing with <lb/>Fig. 2, the morphology and the size of the spherical silica nanospheres <lb/>for Cu@SiO 2 after the catalytic reaction (Fig. S9) shows no obvious <lb/>changes before and after catalytic hydrolysis reaction. The size of the <lb/>Cu NPs embedded in the SiO 2 spheres almost kept unchanged after <lb/>catalytic reaction. In addition, a high temperature, 573 K, was used <lb/>for heat treatment to prepare Cu@SiO 2 -573 K. The Cu@SiO 2 -573 K <lb/>with heat treatment still remain high activity, which release a stoi-<lb/>chiometric amount of H 2 from aqueous AB and HB (H 2 /(AB or HB) <lb/>5 3) in 12.5 and 5.9 min, respectively (Fig. S10 &amp; S11), indicating <lb/>that the Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres have good thermal stability. <lb/>In conclusion, for the first time, we have developed a facile one-pot <lb/>synthetic route to synthesis of ultrafine copper NPs within porous <lb/>silica nanospheres under ambient conditions. The TEM reveals that <lb/>ultrafine Cu NPs of around 2 nm are effectively embedded in the <lb/>center of porous silica nanospheres. The core-shell Cu@SiO 2 NPs <lb/>show a much better catalytic activity, in comparison to the commer-<lb/>cial SiO 2 supported Cu NPs, SiO 2 supported nanospheres Cu NPs, <lb/>and free Cu NPs for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB at <lb/>room temperature. The TOF for Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres in the hydro-<lb/>lytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB are measured to be 3.24 and <lb/>7.58 mol H 2 mol Cu 21 min 21 , respectively. Moreover, the complete <lb/>release of hydrogen is achieved even in the tenth run, and the Cu@ <lb/>SiO 2 nanospheres preserve 90 and 85% of their initial catalytic activ-<lb/>ity for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and HB, respectively, <lb/>indicating that the catalyst has a good reusability. The high perform-<lb/>ance and cost-effective catalyst may strongly encourage the practical <lb/>application of AB and HB as promising hydrogen storage materials. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Materials.

Ultrapure water with the specific resistance of 18.3 MV?cm was <lb/>obtained by reversed osmosis followed by ion exchange and filtration. <lb/>Instrumentation. The microstructure of the samples were investigated using a <lb/>transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with an energy-<lb/>dispersive X-ray detector (EDX). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was <lb/>taken on a SU8020 cold field-emission instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) <lb/>studies were performed on a Rigaku RINT-2200 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka <lb/>source (40 kV, 20 mA). The weight content of copper in Cu@SiO 2 nanospheres was <lb/>analyzed by means of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrophotometer <lb/>(Varian, 725-ES). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was performed with a <lb/>Thermo ESCALAB 250 multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer by using an <lb/>Al Ka source. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out on a <lb/>Micromeritics ASAP 2050 system at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore size <lb/>distribution were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation and <lb/>density functional theory (DFT) method, respectively. Temperature programmed <lb/>desorption (TPD) experiments were measured on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 <lb/>system, and the active surface area (S Cu ) was obtained by CO chemisorption on the <lb/>same instrument. The purity of the obtained HB was determined by Bruker 400 M <lb/>liquid NMR using CD 3 CN as solvent. <lb/>Synthesis of ultrafine copper NPs within porous silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ). <lb/>Ultrafine copper NPs within silica nanospheres (Cu@SiO 2 ) were synthesized via a <lb/>one-pot synthetic route in a reversed micelle system according to the literature <lb/>procedure 45-49 . Briefly, calculated amount of aqueous solution of CuCl 2 ?2H 2 O <lb/>(2.16 mL, 0.12 M) were rapidly injected into 480 mL of NP-5 (20.16 g) cyclohexane <lb/>solution. After stirring at room temperature for about 15 h, an aqueous ammonia <lb/>solution (28 wt%, 2.16 mL) was injected rapidly and after 2 h, TEOS (2.49 mL) was <lb/>added rapidly. The solution was stirred for 2 days at room temperature. The Cu(II)@ <lb/>SiO 2 nanospheres were isolated by addition of methanol to destabilize the reversed-<lb/>micelle system and centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 8 min. The product obtained was <lb/>further washed with cyclohexane and acetone. After drying in vacuum oven at 313 K <lb/>overnight, the Cu(II)@SiO 2 nanospheres were further reduced by 5 mL of aqueous <lb/>AB solution (AB: 0.2 M, Cu/AB 5 0.09). The solids obtained were used as the as-<lb/>synthesized Cu@SiO 2 catalysts. The copper content of the product was analyzed by <lb/>ICP and calculated to be 2.2 wt%. For thermal stability, the Cu(II)@SiO 2 nanospheres <lb/>were calcined at 573 K for 5 h in air, reduced by AB (0.2 M, 5 mL), and label as Cu@ <lb/>SiO 2 -573 K. <lb/>Synthesis of copper NPs supported on silica (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 and Cu/SiO 2 ). <lb/>The copper NPs supported on commercial silica (Cu/Commercial SiO 2 ) and silica <lb/>nanospheres (Cu/SiO 2 ) in this study were prepared by the conventional impregnation <lb/>and subsequent AB reduction (0.2 M, 5 mL). The Cu content was kept to be about <lb/>2.2 wt% and the molar ratio of Cu to AB was kept a constant of 0.09. Silica <lb/>nanospheres, which were prepared using a similar method as for the Cu/@SiO 2 <lb/>nanospheres without copper precursor, were used as the support for preparing silica <lb/>nanospheres supported copper NPs. <lb/>Synthesis of free copper NPs without silica (Cu NPs).
