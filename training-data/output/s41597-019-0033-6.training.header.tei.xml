	<div type="abstract">a central question in the science of science concerns how to develop a quantitative understanding of<lb/> the evolution and impact of individual careers. Over the course of history, a relatively small fraction of<lb/> individuals have made disproportionate, profound, and lasting impacts on science and society. Despite<lb/> a long-standing interest in the careers of scientific elites across diverse disciplines, it remains difficult<lb/> to collect large-scale career histories that could serve as training sets for systematic empirical and<lb/> theoretical studies. Here, by combining unstructured data collected from CVs, university websites,<lb/> and Wikipedia, together with the publication and citation database from Microsoft Academic Graph<lb/> (MAG), we reconstructed publication histories of nearly all Nobel prize winners from the past century,<lb/> through both manual curation and algorithmic disambiguation procedures. Data validation shows that<lb/> the collected dataset presents among the most comprehensive collection of publication records for<lb/> Nobel laureates currently available. As our quantitative understanding of science deepens, this dataset<lb/> is expected to have increasing value. It will not only allow us to quantitatively probe novel patterns<lb/> of productivity, collaboration, and impact governing successful scientific careers, it may also help us<lb/> unearth the fundamental principles underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific breakthroughs.<lb/></div>
