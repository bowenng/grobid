			<p>Microbes are ubiquitous. They can be found everywhere, from radioactive waste to the human gastrointestinal<lb/> tract. In and on the human body, they have evolved to co-exist with their host, and it is estimated that the num-<lb/>ber of microbes hosted by the human body is of the same order of magnitude as the number of human cells <ref type="biblio">1</ref> . In<lb/> particular, the 10 14 commensal microbes in the intestinal tract form the human gut microbiota, which has evolved<lb/> to live in symbiosis with its host <ref type="biblio">2</ref> . It is widely accepted that this symbiosis begins from birth, and the microbial<lb/> communities stabilize with age until the formation of an adult microbiota <ref type="biblio">3</ref> . Its genetic content (called the micro-<lb/>biome) characterizes everyone, also raising concerns about identity and privacy issues, specifically when the study<lb/> and the manipulation of the microbiota are considered <ref type="biblio">4</ref> . Since the 1840s, when the concept of gut microbiota<lb/> first appeared, the topic has been studied for two centuries <ref type="biblio">5</ref> , and, at the moment, it is known that the gut micro-<lb/>biota has a fundamental role in shaping the gut barriers <ref type="biblio">6</ref> , training the host immune system and regulating the<lb/> metabolism <ref type="biblio">7</ref> . When the compositional and metabolic equilibrium of the commensal microbes living in the gut<lb/> is disrupted, different types of diseases arise, such as metabolic disorders or central nervous system disorders <ref type="biblio">8</ref> .<lb/> Historically, traditional medicine attempted to re-establish this equilibrium through remedies intervening in<lb/> the digestive system, such as fasting, diets, and the assumption of spring waters or laxatives. A recent procedure<lb/> that was introduced to tackle the Clostridioides difficile infection is the faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> which consists in repopulating the intestinal tract of an ill subject with the microbiota of a healthy donor.<lb/></p>

			<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which comprise Crohn&apos;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are<lb/> an essential class of diseases that arise from dysbiosis and are being treated with FMT. Typical symptoms of this<lb/> class of diseases are chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue <ref type="biblio">10</ref> . Although CD<lb/> and UC are both characterized by the inflammation of the intestinal tract, there are several differences between<lb/> the two diagnoses that span from the environmental factors that cause them, e.g., smoking or diet, to the clini-<lb/>cal and endoscopic findings in the two diagnoses <ref type="biblio">11</ref> . Overall, IBDs are becoming widespread in modern society<lb/> because of lifestyle changes, socioeconomic developments, and environmental causes <ref type="biblio">12</ref> . Until now, it has been<lb/> known that IBD is an exaggerated immune response to the gut microbiota of genetically predisposed subjects<lb/> under the influence of the external environment. This complex interplay between genetics, the microbiota, the<lb/> immune system and the environment makes it particularly hard to understand this class of diseases. Kirsner <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> offered a complete historical review of the IBD until the 1980s, by quoting Hippocrates, who described diarrhoea<lb/> as a symptom of an infectious (or non-infectious) disease to a description of the hypothetical pathogenesis of<lb/> IBD, which the microbiota was not considered, though. A more recent projection predicted the evolution of the<lb/> disease between 2015 and 2025 and updated the possible origins of IBD, including the action of antibiotics on<lb/> the gut microbiota in Western society <ref type="biblio">14</ref> . Xavier et al. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> summarized the findings of the origins of IBD, mentioning<lb/> the complexity of the disease. Another historical review focuses on the genetics of the IBD <ref type="biblio">16</ref> identified NOD2 as<lb/> the first CD susceptible gene and then described the evolution of the IBD genetics with the coming of the mod-<lb/>ern genome-wide association study. One of the first and most comprehensive works describing the interaction<lb/> of all the aforementioned factors can be found in Ref. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> . The systems biology approach to the study of IBD was<lb/> presented by Fiocchi et al. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> , which proposed the creation of an IBD interactome, a complex system connecting<lb/> all the potential agents interacting among them that derived from the combination of different omics <ref type="biblio">19</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Our work starts from here and attempts to provide tools and methods from network science useful to build<lb/> and study the IBD interactome with a systems biology approach by commencing from the metagenomic data of<lb/> the gut microbiome. This approach is typical of network medicine, a novel discipline that mixes network science<lb/> with systems biology to tackle the challenges offered by the progress of personalized medicine <ref type="biblio">20</ref> , which opposes<lb/> the current effective yet drastic procedures like the FMT. Network science is the discipline used to analyse com-<lb/>plex systems. It could be suited to understand a complex disease like IBD in which a complex system like the gut<lb/> microbiota plays a fundamental role. Complexity in the intestinal microbial communities arises at different scales;<lb/> from the macroscopic point of view, we have the ecological interactions <ref type="biblio">21,22</ref> that describe the relationships among<lb/> the species in the gut microbiota; among these, we have three different main types of interactions <ref type="biblio">23</ref> ; positive<lb/> interactions (cooperation, commensalism, cross-feeding), negative interactions (competition, ammensalism),<lb/> and asymmetric interactions (exploitation, predation, parasitism). Going towards a microscopic scale, we can<lb/> find the gene networks, often represented by gene co-expression networks <ref type="biblio">24</ref> and metabolic networks built by<lb/> connecting the substances, known as metabolites, reacting in the same metabolic processes <ref type="biblio">25</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The application of network science for the study of the complexity of the gut microbiome is recent, and one<lb/> of the first research was in the case of C. difficile infection <ref type="biblio">26</ref> . The microbiome in this work was represented as a<lb/> boolean network derived from binarized temporal data of the abundance of specific bacteria species in the gut.<lb/> Although the study captured the dynamics of the bacterial species, e.g., negative, positive or neutral interac-<lb/>tion, it did not take into account the genetic expression of the microbiome (metagenome), which could better<lb/> explain the complex interplay between the bacterial species. Our study, by contrast, gives a static screenshot of<lb/> the microbial interactions through metagenomics. A more recent study <ref type="biblio">27</ref> analysed the co-abundance network<lb/> built with SparCC 28 ; the need for this tool is due to the necessity of sparsifying the network that would have<lb/> too many correlated nodes because of normalization and a p-value threshold too high <ref type="biblio">29</ref> . Based on a topologi-<lb/>cal property of the biological networks, the work by Vernocchi et al. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> portrays a weighted gene co-expression<lb/> network analysis by building a network from metagenomic data and removing the weaker edges based on the<lb/> assumption that the final network would be scale-free. In our work, we used thresholding methods that rely on<lb/> the network topology, such as the percolation threshold or the p-value for the projected edges, similar to the later<lb/> research. These methods should overcome the aforementioned problems. Furthermore, the emergence of specific<lb/> network properties (community detection, betweenness centrality) can be used as possible IBD biomarkers. In a<lb/> complex system, such as the gut microbiota, it is hard to observe changes in single biomarkers. Diseases emerge<lb/> from malfunctioning in the collective behaviour of the nodes. Therefore, community detection and between-<lb/>ness centralities are important properties to be analysed. The former describes how the pathways are grouped<lb/> in the complex system and the latter represents the pillar pathways among all the interactions that sustain the<lb/> collective functioning of the network.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<p>In the next paragraphs, each pathway is called with a code name composed of the pathway code and the related<lb/> species (e.g., &quot;PATHWAYCODE|SPECIES&quot;) for the sake of brevity and clarity, it is possible to consult the table<lb/> mapping the correspondences between the codes and the complete pathway (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> of Supplementary Mate-<lb/>rial). The properties of the main pathways can be found in the same table, the BioCyc <ref type="biblio">30</ref> and the MetaCyc 31 col-<lb/>lections. The small set of reads that are mapped to proteins and are not associated with pangenomics are labelled<lb/> as &quot;unclassified&quot; <ref type="biblio">32</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<head>Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii<lb/></head>

			<p>The correlation networks for each diagnosis were obtained by isolating the samples of each diagnosis and then<lb/> calculating the Pearson correlation of the samples to obtain a weighted network that was made binary through a<lb/> percolation threshold of each diagnosis network ( th DIAGNOSIS ). Each correlation network was built by collecting<lb/> the pathways from subjects diagnosed with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or healthy non-IBD (NI).<lb/> The pathways were divided into prevalent (if present in more than 75% of the samples), common (if present in<lb/> 50% to 75% of the samples) and uncommon (if present in 25% to 50% of the samples). We refer to the Methods<lb/> section for a more detailed description of the methods. In the prevalent pathways, the number of edges in the NI<lb/> correlation network was 3356 ( th NI = 0.453 ), in CD correlation network was 2905 ( th CD = 0.357 ), and in the<lb/> UC correlation network was 3160 ( th UC = 0.364 ). The results showed that the NI metagenome was more con-<lb/>nected for prevalent pathways and the percolation threshold was higher compared to the percolation thresholds<lb/> in the CD and the UC correlation networks, translating into more strongly correlated nodes in the NI correlation<lb/> network. The community detection algorithm, which reveals the groups (called modules or communities) of<lb/> nodes in the network based on their topological similarities, aims to maximise the modularity. The maximised<lb/> modularity is an important descriptor of the network structure; the lower the modularity, the lower the total<lb/> number of modules. We obtained that the lowest modularity (0.538) can be found in the NI correlation network,<lb/> meaning that it was not possible to separate some of the modules and there would be interconnections between<lb/> them, the CD and the UC correlation networks resulted in a modularity of 0.583 and 0.622, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>As we can see in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the pathways in the NI correlation network were divided into three large modules,<lb/> one module was isolated, by contrast, the other two modules were communicating strictly through several<lb/> nodes. The isolated module was composed of Phocaeicola vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis pathways, this<lb/> meant that in control subjects the two species co-variated and were interdependent through specific pathways<lb/> (on the frontiers of the species modules, it was possible to find nodes PWY-6387|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS,<lb/> PWY-6151|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS, PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|BACTEIROIDES_UNIFORMIS,<lb/> PWY-5667|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS on the B. uniformis side and nodes PANTO-PWY|PHOCAEICOLA_<lb/> VULGATUS, PWY-6700|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS, PWY-7220|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS, PWY-<lb/>7222|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS on the P. vulgatus side). The light purple module, on the other hand,<lb/> contained Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas the remaining large module contained the Bacteroides ovatus<lb/> pathways, Eubacterium rectale pathways, and the unclassified species pathways. The nodes with the highest<lb/> betweenness centrality (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), the importance given by the number of shortest paths crossing the node, among<lb/> the unclassified pathways in the two connected modules were connected through:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. node PWY-6527|UNCLASSIFIED;<lb/> 2. node GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED;<lb/> 3. node PWY66-422|UNCLASSIFIED;<lb/> 4. node PWY-6317|UNCLASSIFIED.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whereas, the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality among the F. prausnitzii pathway module that was<lb/> connected to the unclassified pathway module were:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. node PWY-5659|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII;<lb/> 2. node PWY-6277|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII;<lb/> 3. node PWY-6121|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII;<lb/> 4. node PWY-6122|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII.<lb/></p>

			<p>To notice that pathway of node PWY-5659|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII correlated with only 4 E.<lb/> rectale pathways.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the CD correlation network, there were fewer connections, and the network was divided into 6 mod-<lb/>ules. Each module corresponded to the species groups of pathways. The smallest module was composed of E.<lb/> rectale pathways. The largest (light purple) module comprising F. prausnitzii was connected to the unclassi-<lb/>fied (green) module using node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED similar to the UC correlation network. Moreo-<lb/>ver, an additional bridge connecting node was node SER-GLYSYN-PWY|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUS-<lb/>NITZII, which was linked to nodes PWY-6527|UNCLASSIFIED and ILEUSYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED, to<lb/> mention two high betweenness centrality nodes among the unclassified pathways. High betweenness central-<lb/>ity nodes DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED and PWY-5659|BACTEROIDES_OVATUS connected<lb/> unclassified species module with B. ovatus module, node PWY-6124|BACTEROIDES_OVATUS, in turn, was<lb/> connected to node PWY-7219|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS linking B. ovatus module to the B. uniformis<lb/> module. Finally, similarly to the NI correlation network, P. vulgatus and B. uniformis were connected though<lb/> (nodes PWY-3841|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS, PWY-7221|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS, and PWY-<lb/>7228|PHOCAEICOLA_VULGATUS on the former side and nodes PWY0-845|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS<lb/></p>

			<p>and 1CMET2-PWY|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS on the latter side). The pathways with the highest between-<lb/>ness centralities can be found in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The pathways in the UC correlation network were divided into 5 modules. The smallest module (coral red) was<lb/> composed of E. rectale pathways scattered around the network. The dark green nodes mixed with the turquoise<lb/> nodes were B. ovatus pathways mixed with B. uniformis pathways, respectively. The green module comprised of<lb/> unclassified species pathways, whereas, the light purple module comprised of F. prausnitzii pathways. The green<lb/> and the light purple modules were strictly connected similarly to the NI correlation network, the pathways con-<lb/>necting them were the node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED, which was linked to several nodes of both modules and<lb/> node PWY-6121|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, which was linked to nodes PWY-724|UNCLASSIFIED<lb/> and THRESYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED. Even E. rectale behaved as a bridge between the two large modules<lb/> through a few connections. Furthermore, there was one node of F. prausnitzii module that was deeply correlated<lb/> with all the P. vulgatus pathways: node DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII. Finally,<lb/> two nodes with high betweenness centrality were node PWY-6737|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII in the<lb/> light purple module and node PWY-6703|BACTEROIDES_UNIFORMIS in the mixed dark green and turquoise<lb/> module (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Differently from the NI correlation network, B. uniformis did not correlate P. vulgatus,<lb/> whereas it correlated with B. ovatus.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we have projected the bipartite network, a graph with two distinct sets of nodes (namely samples and<lb/> pathways), onto the nodes of the bacterial pathways and we validate the projection through a null model (with the<lb/> following parameters; significance threshold α = 0.05 and family-wise error rate fwer = none ). Again, we divided<lb/> the pathways according to their presence along with the samples. We considered the case of 75% of the presence<lb/> across the samples for NI subjects. We found 1715 edges for 153 nodes and the community detection resulted in 6<lb/> large communities; namely, the unclassified species community, the F. prausnitzii community, the E. rectale com-<lb/>munity, the B. uniformis community, the B. ovatus community and P. vulgatus community. All the communities<lb/> identified were isolated, the node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED was connected to the unclassified module through<lb/> the nodes PWY-6609|UNCLASSIFIED, PWY-3001|UNCLASSIFIED, and THRESYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED.<lb/> Also, nodes PWY-5100|UNCLASSIFIED and PANTO-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED were separated from the rest of<lb/> the unclassified module. Considering F. prausnitzii module, nodes PWY0-1586|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUS-<lb/>NITZII, PWY-6305|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, and PWY-5659|-FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUS-<lb/>NITZII were disconnected from the rest of the module. In Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, the pathways with the highest centrality<lb/> belonged to unclassified and F. prausnitzii. This can explained by the fact that the two groups of pathways are<lb/> merged in a unique module.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the CD case, there were 153 nodes and 1615 edges, the community detection algorithm identified 6 differ-<lb/>ent modules, one for each bacterial species identified in the previous cases. All the communities were isolated<lb/> without nodes connecting them. Differently from the NI case, node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED does not result<lb/> in connection to the rest of the unclassified module. Similarly to the NI case, node PWY-5100|UNCLASSIFIED<lb/> was not isolated, whereas node PANTO-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED was well connected to the rest of the unclassi-<lb/>fied module. When F. prausnitzii was considered, we obtained that node PWY0-1586|FAECALIBACTERIUM_<lb/> PRAUSNITZII was connected to nodes PWY-6317|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII and PWY66-<lb/>422|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, that both were well connected to the F. prausnitzii pathways.<lb/> Also, node PWY-6305|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII differently from the NI projected network is<lb/> connected to two nodes of the bacterium module, namely PWY-6122|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAU-SNITZII<lb/> and PWY-6277|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, which were both pathways involving 5-aminoimidazole<lb/> ribonucleotide. On the other hand, node PWY-5659|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII was connected<lb/> to node PWY-5695|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII and nodes, PWY-6317|FAECALIBACTERIUM_<lb/> PRAUSNITZII and PWY66-422|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, where the former was involved in<lb/> the biosynthesis of urate and the latter were involved in the degradation of galactose. Similarly to the NI case, in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, the pathways with the highest centrality belonged to unclassified and F. prausnitzii.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the UC case, we could find 153 nodes and 669 edges. Differently from the previous cases, the commu-<lb/>nity detection algorithm could not isolate modules corresponding to the 6 species of the prevalent pathway<lb/> group. The F. prausnitzii module was split into two modules held together by the nodes GLCMANNANAUT-<lb/>PWY|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII and PWY-5686|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII. Simi-<lb/>larly to the CD projected network, node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED was isolated from the rest of the unclas-<lb/>sified module, whereas node PWY-5100|UNCLASSIFIED was connected to the rest of the module by means<lb/> of nodes BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED, ILEUSYN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED, PWY-<lb/>5103|UNCLASSIFIED, and CALVIN-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED. Differently from the NI projected network and<lb/> similarly to the CD projected network, in the UC projected network, the node PANTO-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED<lb/> was well connected to the rest of the unclassified module. When the F. prausnitzii module was considered,<lb/> nodes PWY0-1586|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAU-SNITZII, PWY-6305|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUS-<lb/>NITZII, and PWY-5659|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII were isolated from the rest of the module in<lb/> the same fashion as the NI case. Furthermore, the UC projected network by displaying fewer connections<lb/> had more isolated pathways compared to the NI and the CD case. For instance, nodes DTDPRHAMSYN-<lb/>PWY|BACTEROIDES_OVATUS and PWY-7282|BACTEROIDES_OVATUS detached from the B. ovatus<lb/></p>

			<p>As it is possible to observe in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the relatively uncommon pathways were 910 in total. There were 49203 edges<lb/> in NI correlation network ( th NI = 0.474 ), 42617 edges in CD correlation network ( th CD = 0.446 ), 44523 edges in<lb/> UC correlation network ( th UC = 0.465 ). The number of edges was comparable in the three networks. We could<lb/> observe 9 modules in the NI correlation network (modularity 0.623), 9 modules in the CD correlation network<lb/> (modularity 0.644), and 6 modules in the UC correlation network (modularity 0.695). In every network, it was<lb/> possible to identify an approximately isolated ball-shaped module containing E. coli pathways. It was interesting<lb/> to highlight the position of B. fragilis pathways in respect of E. coli pathways in the different diagnoses. In the<lb/> NI correlation network, B. fragilis pathways were connected to the E. coli module through Veillonella parvula<lb/> pathways, by contrast, in the UC correlation network, B. fragilis pathways were incorporated and surrounded<lb/> by the same module containing E. coli pathways, whereas in the CD correlation network, the bacterial path-<lb/>ways of the two species were separated. In the NI correlation network, the module containing E. coli included<lb/> also bacterial pathways of other species, notably Eubacterium siraeum and Ruminococcus gnavus pathways that<lb/> behaved as bridge nodes between E. coli containing the module and the rest of the network. In the CD correlation<lb/> network, this role was assumed by Roseburia intestinalis and V. parvula, whereas, in the UC correlation network,<lb/> we did not observe any pathways behaving as bridge nodes. An additional important module that was also the<lb/></p>

			<p>largest was the one mainly composed of R. torques, Anaerostipes hadrus, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5 1 63FAA,<lb/> plus other minor species. The pathways belonging to the last two mentioned species were strictly intertwined<lb/> forming the second largest ball-shaped group of nodes. The same ball-shaped group of nodes was present in the<lb/> CD correlation network, by contrast, in the UC correlation network, the two species were in the same module<lb/> and the nodes were not mixed in the ball but they laid separately. The highest betweenness centralities of each<lb/> correlation network can be found respectively in Tables 7, 8, and 9. The NI network contains a variety of central<lb/> pathways from different bacterium species, by contrast, the UC network has several central pathways belonging<lb/> to Enterocloster bolteae.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the NI network projection, we obtained a network with 910 nodes and 20078 edges. As it is possible to<lb/> notice in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, several modules emerged from the network. The most evident was the E. coli module which<lb/> was one of the modules that composed the E. coli group in the uncommon pathways. This bigger module was<lb/></p>

			<p>Curiously there was also a Enterocloster bolteae pathway well-connected to the E. coli main module (node PWY0-<lb/>1296|ENTERO-CLOSTER_BOLTEAE). The remaining part of the E. coli group was represented by fatty acid<lb/> metabolism pathways (node FAO-PWY|ESCHERICHIA_COLI) or pathways involving mannose biosynthesis,<lb/> which were connected to other species&apos; pathways. Apart from these nodes scattered around the network, the<lb/> species group had two main ball-shaped modules thanks to the well-connected nature of the nodes inside the<lb/> module. Another interesting community was the module formed by the nodes of two different species L. bac-<lb/>terium 5 1 63FAA and A. hadrus. The edges connecting the nodes of the two species were so dense that the two<lb/> groups formed a unique module. Similarly to the NI correlation network, the NI projected network (Table <ref type="table">10</ref>)<lb/> has diverse central pathways compared to the CD and UC projected network (Tables <ref type="table">11 and 12</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<p>In the CD network projection, there were 910 nodes and 26505 edges. One of the immediately visible proper-<lb/>ties of the projected network was the isolated module composed of E. coli pathways. Compared to the NI case,<lb/> there were no connections to the other species nodes. R. torques module was connected to A. hadrus module,<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly to the NI case, node GLCMANNANAUT-PWY|RUMINOCOCCUS_TORQUES was connected only<lb/> to pathways of other species.

			<p>The UC network projection had 910 and only 10140 edges. The first striking property of this network was<lb/> that there were much fewer edges compared to the previous two cases.

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In the literature, the reduction of F. prausnitzii has been associated with IBD <ref type="biblio">33</ref> ; nevertheless, in our results, we<lb/> recognized that instead of a decrease in the quantity of F. prausnitzii pathways expressed, there was a change in<lb/> the wiring in the metagenomic network. In particular, what changed from the NI correlation network and the IBD<lb/> correlation networks were the bridge pathways connecting the module of unclassified pathways and the module<lb/> containing the F. prausnitzii pathways. For instance, in the NI correlation network, the bridge pathway was node<lb/> PWY-6527|UNCLASSIFIED, whereas, in the IBD networks, the bridge pathways between the two modules were<lb/> node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED. The correlation between these bridge nodes and the nodes in the aforemen-<lb/>tioned modules meant that both modules relied on that specific pathway to function correctly. On the one hand,<lb/> the central substance was the tetrasaccharide stachyose which is degraded into UDP-alpha-D-glucose and has<lb/> been recognized as a potential probiotic against enterotoxigenic E. coli <ref type="biblio">34</ref> ; on the other hand, there was coenzyme<lb/> A, which has a fundamental role in the metabolism and, in particular, is important in the oxidation of fatty acids.<lb/></p>

			<p>Several studies linked the alteration of fatty acid production to the IBDs; hence, this change in the centrality of<lb/> the pathway related to this substance could be investigated further to explain the origins of IBDs <ref type="biblio">34</ref> . The modules<lb/> of Bacteroides in IBD networks corresponded to the single species, whilst in the NI network are gathered in one<lb/> module. This could demonstrate that in IBDs the different Bacteroides species proliferates the gut independently.<lb/> This fact can confirm the meta-analysis by <ref type="biblio">35</ref> , which showed that lower levels of Bacteroides were associated<lb/> with IBDs. Other pathways differentially wired between NI and IBD networks are those involving the bacterial<lb/> metabolite 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (nodes PWY-6121|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, PWY-<lb/>6122|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, PWY-6277|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII). These nodes<lb/> were behaving as bridges in the NI correlation network; by contrast, in the IBD correlation networks, they were<lb/> substituted by a unique bridge node (node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the range of uncommon bacterial species, we can observe the E. coli module; in the literature, this bacterial<lb/> species has a recognized role in the development of IBD <ref type="biblio">36,37</ref> . It was possible to observe the different interplay<lb/> between E. coli, V. parvula and B. fragilis across the different diagnoses. The increase of E. coli and B. fragilis in<lb/> IBD was observed in a previous study <ref type="biblio">38</ref> , but our results provide additional information about the differential<lb/> wiring scheme of the aforementioned species. In particular, it seemed that V. parvula pathways mediated the con-<lb/>nection of E. coli with the other module in the correlation network. In particular, in the NI correlation network,<lb/> V. parvula pathways were in the same module of B. fragilis pathways which were connected to the rest of the<lb/> correlation network. In the CD correlation network, V. parvula pathways were included in the E. coli module, to<lb/> remark how close the two bacterial species were, but if, on the one hand, the relationship between E. coli and B.<lb/> fragilis has been already studied, the effect of V. parvula on E. coli has to be investigated yet in the literature. In<lb/> the UC correlation network, V. parvula formed an almost completely isolated module far from the E. coli, this<lb/></p>

			<p>result could differentiate the connectome of the UC microbiome from the connectome of the CD microbiome.<lb/> The isolation of the E. coli module in the UC correlation network could further represent the peculiar features<lb/> of the particular form of IBD. This isolation meant that there were no correlations with the other pathways, and<lb/> the metagenomic expression pattern across the samples correlated only inside the same bacterial species. In<lb/> the NI correlation network, E. siraeum and R. gnavus pathways were the two main bridge pathways between E.<lb/> coli and the rest of the network, it could be possible to hypothesize that re-establishing a connection between<lb/> E. coli module with the aforementioned bacterial species could lead back to healthy gut microbiota. In the CD<lb/> correlation network, R. intestinalis pathways had the role of bridge pathways, and, in fact, by using the permuta-<lb/>tion tests between the NI and CD samples, we obtained that the most differential pathways were R. intestinalis<lb/> pathways. In the literature, this bacterial species, which has anti-inflammatory properties on the intestinal walls,<lb/> was depleted in IBD subjects; nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying its protective action against IBDs are<lb/> still unknown <ref type="biblio">39,40</ref> . In the uncommon bacterial pathways of the NI projected network, the E. coli module was<lb/> connected to the E. bolteae, which, in turn, was linked to Bifidobacterium longum module. B. longum is a bacte-<lb/>rial species that can have anti-inflammatory properties in the human gut <ref type="biblio">10</ref> . By contrast, in the CD projected<lb/> network, E. coli was connected to the rest of the network through two Dorea longicatena pathways, which were<lb/> nodes PWY-6163|DOREA_LONGICATENA and COA-PWY-1|DOREA_LONGICATENA and were connected<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> Database<lb/></head>

			<p>The first step of the workflow (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) starts from the raw data which was taken from the Inflammatory Bowel<lb/> Disease Multi&apos; omics Database (IBDMDB) <ref type="biblio">41</ref> is one of the first publicly available comprehensive studies of the<lb/> gut ecosystem&apos;s multiple molecular properties involved in the IBD dynamics. Some of the measurements of the<lb/> microbiome offered by the study are metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics. The data is related<lb/> to 132 subjects approached in the following five medical centres: Cincinnati Children&apos;s Hospital, Emory Univer-<lb/>sity Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, and Cedars-Sinai<lb/> Medical Centre. The patients recruited for the study initially arrived at the hospitals either for routine age-related<lb/> colorectal cancer screening, the presence of other gastrointestinal symptoms, or suspected IBD. The latter could<lb/> be a consequence of positive imaging, symptoms of chronic diarrhoea or rectal bleeding. If there were no con-<lb/>ditions for exclusion right after enrolment, a preliminary colonoscopy was performed to determine the study<lb/> strata. Based on initial analyses, the subjects that were not diagnosed with IBD (non-IBD) were labelled as &apos;NI&apos;<lb/> controls. This group of subjects included the patients who arrived for routine screening and those with more<lb/></p>

			<p>benign or non-specific symptoms <ref type="biblio">42</ref> . The IBDMDB website contains the raw and the final results of the processed<lb/> information, the complete pipeline for producing the final results is:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. Quality and error checking for completeness, producing raw files.<lb/> 2. AnADAMA pipeline, producing products.<lb/></p>

			<p>In particular, if we consider the pipeline for producing the metagenomic data, after stool collection, the samples<lb/> for the quality control process go through the KneadData 43 and the AnADAMA pipelines. The former is a tool<lb/> useful to exclude the reads, which are fragments of DNA, related to the host or related to other contaminants<lb/> from the metagenomic sequencing data, and this separation step is made completely in silico. Whereas the lat-<lb/>ter, the Anadama pipeline, performs and produces documents from an automated scientific workflow, where<lb/> a workflow is simply a succession of tasks, such as quantifying operational taxonomic units (OTU). The OTUs<lb/> are classifications of groups of bacteria closely related to each other by sequence similarity. On the IBDMDB<lb/> website, there are two versions of data Version 2.0 and Version 3.0. Version 3.0 has been uploaded<lb/> with the new version of bioBakery <ref type="biblio">44</ref> . In our work, we use the products file related to the functional profiles<lb/> Version 2.0. Moreover, we exploit the HMP2 Metadata file, containing the sample IDs, the subject IDs and<lb/> the properties associated with each sample. The External ID is the unique ID of the sample, Partici-<lb/>pant ID is the subject from where the sample has been taken, diagnosis is either ulcerative colitis (UC),<lb/> Crohn&apos;s disease (CD) or control group (NI), week_num points out the week number, when the sample has<lb/> been taken and data_type is the type of sample (metagenomics, 16S, etc.). we extracted useful information<lb/> to avoid importing the whole database, and we selected only the samples from the first week (week 0). Moreover,<lb/> the samples different from metagenomic ones were excluded. Finally, we dropped the samples from the same<lb/> participant in week 0 and obtained a list of samples IDs that were present in both the metagenomic database<lb/> and the HMP2 Metadata. The metagenomic database contains as row indexes the gene descriptors; specifi-<lb/>cally, the descriptor is composed of the pathway, genus and species (e.g., &quot;ARO-PWY: chorismate biosynthesis<lb/> I |g__Alistipes.s__Alistipes_finegoldii&quot;). To generate the database, the algorithm HUMAnN2 32 has been used.<lb/> The algorithm can be divided into three phases; firstly, the metagenomic sample is quickly analyzed to seek<lb/> known species in the gut microbiome. The functional annotation of the identified pangenomes (i.e. the genome<lb/> of a larger group of species) of the microbiome is concatenated to form a gene database of the sample. Secondly,<lb/> using this database, the whole sample is aligned, meaning that statistics regarding the species and the genes are<lb/> made, and unmapped reads are collected. Thirdly, the gene abundances are calculated, and they are combined<lb/> with the metabolic network to determine the pathways in the microbial community.<lb/></p>

			<p>To reduce the number of pathways present in the resulting network, we built the correlation matrices and<lb/> the biadjacency matrices for the projected networks for three different groups of pathways based on quantiles;<lb/> namely, one group for the pathways expressed in a percentage between 25% and 50% of the subjects (uncommon<lb/> pathways), another group for those in the range between 50% and 75% (common pathways), and lastly a group<lb/> for the pathways expressed in more than 75% (prevalent pathways). Originally, there were 953 nodes among the<lb/> uncommon pathways. 43 nodes were disconnected from the rest of the network in the correlation networks,<lb/> hence, we chose to exclude these pathways from our analysis in both the correlation and projected networks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Correlation Networks<lb/></head>

			<p>Correlation networks are built from the following steps:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. pairwise gene similarity score (correlation);<lb/> 2. thresholding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Normalization methods, correlation measures (Pearson or Spearman), significance and relevance are still<lb/> debated <ref type="biblio">45</ref> . In our work, we chose the Pearson correlation similar to Ref. <ref type="biblio">46</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>To transform a correlation matrix into a correlation network, we used a thresholding method inspired by a<lb/> brain network technique that was used to cut the least important edges and keep the significant relationships<lb/> among the nodes, hence, we calculated the absolute value of the correlations, making the signs irrelevant. This<lb/> method consists of increasing a cut-off threshold until the network connectivity breaks apart; because of this<lb/> property, this cut-off threshold is also known as the percolation threshold. This method has been considered<lb/> one of the most effective methods to maximise the information quantity kept by the network <ref type="biblio">47</ref> . In our work, we<lb/> started from a cut-off threshold of t = 0 , and we used a bisection method to get to the percolation threshold.<lb/> In the bisection method, we flattened the absolute values in the weighted adjacency matrix into a sorted array,<lb/> chose the median value and used it as the new cut-off threshold, we calculated the connectivity of the graph<lb/> built from the adjacency matrix having this cut-off threshold, finally, if we obtained a connected graph with the<lb/> median value as a cut-off threshold, we used as the sorted array the upper half array, on the contrary, we used<lb/> the lower half. The procedure was iterative until convergence which corresponded to an array with zero length<lb/> or with the same head and same tail.<lb/></p>

			<head>Co-expression network from bipartite projected networks<lb/></head>

			<p>Bipartite networks are graphs G = (U, V , E) where the nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets, U and V, and<lb/> every edge in E links an element in U to an element in V. In our work, we designated with U the set of nodes<lb/> representing the genes and with V the set of nodes representing the samples. We can find in E all the edges con-<lb/>necting the gene u to the sample v if the gene was over-expressed in the corresponding sample. We evaluated<lb/> the over-expression of a gene through the binarization of the data that led to the construction of a biadjacency<lb/> matrix B of size |U| × |V | that described the bipartite network G = (U, V , E) with the entries (0, 1), where B ij = 1<lb/> if the gene v i is over-expressed in the sample u j , and B ij = 0 if it is not over-expressed. Biadjacency matrices are<lb/> rectangular matrices where on one side there are the nodes in U, and on the other side the nodes in V.<lb/></p>

			<head>Binarization<lb/></head>

			<p>The binarization process is useful to highlight the edges in E that are over-expressed. By using the revealed<lb/> comparative advantage (RCA) <ref type="biblio">48</ref> , We highlighted the over-expressed genes for specific samples:<lb/></p>

			<p>where E is the expression of the gene i in the sample j. When RCA ij &gt; 1 , the quantity of gene i in sample j can<lb/> be considered over-expressed and the entry b ij = 1 (where b ij is the element of the final biadjacency matrix), in<lb/> the other case RCA ij ≤ 1 , then b ij = 0.<lb/></p>

			<head>Randomization of bipartite networks<lb/></head>

			<p>To generate a null model useful to calculate the statistically important properties of a real bipartite network, we<lb/> randomized the bipartite networks by using the package BiCM <ref type="biblio">49</ref> . In particular, the package is based on the works<lb/> by Ref. <ref type="biblio">50-52</ref> . In the aforementioned works, the Shannon entropy is defined as<lb/> is maximized, where G is an ensemble of binary, undirected, bipartite networks, and<lb/> -→<lb/> C (M) is a given set of<lb/> constraints. The result is:<lb/></p>

				<formula>Where H M,<lb/> -→<lb/> θ =<lb/> -→<lb/> θ •<lb/> -→<lb/> C (M) is the Hamiltonian and Z<lb/> -→<lb/> θ = M∈G e<lb/> -H M,<lb/> -→<lb/></formula>

			<p>θ is the normalization. In<lb/> the case of the bipartite extension of the configuration model (BiCM), the Hamiltonian becomes:<lb/></p>

			<p>because we have two layers of nodes and we constrained the degree sequences<lb/> -→<lb/> d (M) and -→ u (M) .<lb/></p>

			<p>-→<lb/> d (M) is the<lb/> degree sequence of the genes and -→ u (M) is the degree sequence of the samples.<lb/></p>

			<head>Projection<lb/></head>

			<p>One way to compress the information contained in a bipartite network is to project the bipartite network onto<lb/> one of the two layers (gene/pathway layer or sample layer). We carried out the projection by connecting in the<lb/> same layer the nodes that were linked by a common node in the other layer. The projection leads to a loss of<lb/> information itself, so to avoid further loss of information, we weighted the edges by the number of common<lb/> nodes neighbouring the nodes in the same layer <ref type="biblio">53</ref> . The algorithm to perform the projection is:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. select the partition on which the projection will be done<lb/> 2. take two nodes of the selected partition, n and n ′ , and calculate their similarity<lb/> 3. by evaluating the corresponding p-value compute the statistical significance of the calculated similarity with<lb/> respect to a properly-defined null model;<lb/> 4. if, and only if, the p-value associated with the link n and n ′ is statistically significant, connect the selected<lb/> nodes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The similarity in the second step of the algorithm is evaluated by:<lb/> where V c<lb/> nn ′ ≡ m nc m n ′ c and it is clear from the definition that V c<lb/> nn ′ = 1 if, and only if, both n and n ′ are common<lb/> neighbours of c. The third step of the algorithm passes through the calculation of the p-value of the Poisson-<lb/>Binomial distribution, i.e. the probability of observing a number of V-motifs greater than, or equal to, the<lb/> observed one (which will be indicated as V *<lb/> nn ′ :<lb/></p>

			<p>(1)<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, in the last step of the algorithm, in order to understand which p-values were significant, a false-discovery<lb/> rate or FDR has been adopted to take into account the fact that we were testing multiple hypotheses <ref type="biblio">54</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<head>Betweenness centrality<lb/></head>

			<p>There are many different centrality measures in network science, namely degree centrality, betweenness central-<lb/>ity, and eigenvector centrality; these measures describe the importance of a node in the network. In our work,<lb/> we considered only the betweenness centrality, because it was the most suited to represent the importance of<lb/> the pathways, i.e. the nodes. The betweenness centrality was introduced by Freeman 55 , and it considers more<lb/> important the nodes that behave as bridges in the network. It can be calculated as:<lb/></p>

			<p>where σ st is the number of shortest paths connecting s and t, whilst σ st (i) is the number of shortest paths con-<lb/>necting s and t and going through i.<lb/></p>

			<head>Community detection<lb/></head>

			<p>In the study of network science, both natural complex networks and artificial complex networks display a modu-<lb/>lar behaviour, i.e. groups of nodes are more densely connected within the members of the group than with the<lb/> rest of the network. This phenomenon can also be described by a function called modularity <ref type="biblio">56</ref> , which can be<lb/> used as a parameter for one of the several ways to perform community detection in complex networks. In our<lb/> work, we used the Louvain method <ref type="biblio">57</ref> because it is suited to large complex networks, moreover, this method is<lb/> usually used when it is assumed that the gut microbiome of a healthy subject is a singular assortative network <ref type="biblio">58</ref> .<lb/> We hypothesized that the modularity changes if the network represents the gut microbiome of an IBD subject.<lb/> Louvain method is based on an optimization problem that can be solved in a time O(n • log 2 n) where n is the<lb/> number of nodes in the network <ref type="biblio">59</ref> . The method is based on the aforementioned modularity optimization. Modu-<lb/>larity is defined as in Ref. <ref type="biblio">60</ref> ,<lb/></p>

			<p>The algorithm is based on two phases that repeat iteratively. In the first phase, each node is repeatedly moved<lb/> individually between the communities to maximize modularity. The first phase stops when no further individual<lb/> move can improve the modularity. In the second phase, each community formed in the first phase is considered<lb/> as a node of a weighted graph, where the weights of the edges are given by the sum of the edges connecting the<lb/> nodes in the communities. The algorithm has a high efficiency partly because the gain modularity Q , due to<lb/> moving a node i into a community C, can be steadily calculated as:<lb/></p>

			<p>where in is the sum of the weights of the edges inside C, tot is the sum of the weights of the edges going from<lb/> the outside to the nodes inside C, k i is the sum of the weights of the edges going to node i, and k i,in is the sum of<lb/> the weights of the edges going from i to the nodes in C and, finally, m is the sum of the weights of all the edges<lb/> in the graph. One of the limitations of community detection based on modularity is the resolution limit <ref type="biblio">61</ref> . This<lb/> limitation to modularity may be present when l s ≈<lb/> √<lb/> 2L , where l s is the number of internal links in a module S<lb/> and L is the total number of links in the network and it can be overcome through several methods, one of the<lb/> most promising is Surprise maximization <ref type="biblio">62</ref> . The modularity in correlation networks differs from the modularity<lb/> in projected networks mainly because, in the former networks, the information being represented is based on<lb/> the covariance of the pathway expressions across all the subjects, whereas, in the latter networks, the information<lb/> is built on a cumulative measure that counts the number of subjects sharing common pathways. Therefore, in<lb/> the first case, community detection identifies groups of correlated pathways and, in the second case, it identifies<lb/> pathways that often appear in the same subject.<lb/></p>
