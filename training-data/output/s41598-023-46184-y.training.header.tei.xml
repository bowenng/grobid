	<div type="abstract">Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex medical conditions in which the gut microbiota is<lb/> attacked by the immune system of genetically predisposed subjects when exposed to yet unclear<lb/> environmental factors. The complexity of this class of diseases makes them suitable to be represented<lb/> and studied with network science. In this paper, the metagenomic data of control, Crohn&apos;s disease,<lb/> and ulcerative colitis subjects&apos; gut microbiota were investigated by representing this data as<lb/> correlation networks and co-expression networks. We obtained correlation networks by calculating<lb/> Pearson&apos;s correlation between gene expression across subjects. A percolation-based procedure<lb/> was used to threshold and binarize the adjacency matrices. In contrast, co-expression networks<lb/> involved the construction of the bipartite subjects-genes networks and the monopartite genes-genes<lb/> projection after binarization of the biadjacency matrix. Centrality measures and community detection<lb/> were used on the so-built networks to mine data complexity and highlight possible biomarkers of<lb/> the diseases. The main results were about the modules of Bacteroides, which were connected in the<lb/> control subjects&apos; correlation network, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, where co-enzyme A became<lb/> central in IBD correlation networks and Escherichia coli, whose module has different patterns of<lb/> integration within the whole network in the different diagnoses.</div>
